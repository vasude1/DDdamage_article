   abstract = {Consequences of the use of strain-softening models are reviewed both theoretically and numerically. A most serious consequence of strain-softening is that it may cause snap-back behavior on a structural level. This is demonstrated by means of two concrete structures, a reinforced concrete structure and an unreinforeed specimen. In order to simulate the highly localized failure mode in a strain-softening solid, it appeared necessary to modify the arc-length method. The paper furthermore demonstrates that bifurcation points which occur in strain-softening solids can be located by numerical methods and that the post-bifurcation response can be traced successfully. © 1987.},

   abstract = {Gradient damage models used in phase-field approaches to brittle fracture are characterised by material softening and instabilities. We present novel numerical techniques for the bifurcation and stability analysis along quasi-static evolution paths as well as practical tools to select stable evolutions. Our approach stems from the variational approach to fracture and the theory of rate-independent irreversible processes whereby a quasi-static evolution is formulated in terms of incremental energy minimisation under unilateral constraints. Focusing on the discrete setting obtained with finite elements techniques, we discuss the links between bifurcation criteria for an evolution and stability of equilibrium states. Key concepts are presented through the analytical solution of a two-degrees-of-freedom model featuring a continuum family of bifurcation branches. We introduce numerical methods to (i) assess (second-order) stability conditions for time-discrete evolutions subject to damage irreversibility, and (ii) to select possible stable evolutions based on an energetic criterion. Our approach is based on the solution of a coupled eigenvalue problem which accounts for the time-discrete irreversibility constraint on damage. Several numerical examples illustrate that this approach allows us to filter out unstable solutions provided by standard (first-order) minimisation algorithms as well as to effectively compute stable evolution paths. We demonstrate our purpose on a multifissuration problem featuring complex fracture patterns, to show how the eigenvalue analysis enables to compute and retrieve morphological properties of emerging cracks.},

The experimental data showed that the jet boiling heat transfer for the water CuO nanofluid is significantly different from those for water. The nanofluids have poor nucleate boiling heat transfer compared with the base fluid due to that a very thin nanoparticle sorption layer was formed on the heated surface.

The application phase simulation of computational dynamic fracture is applied to model by which the crack propagation history and variation of crack velocity are predicted using the material dynamic fracture toughness. The dynamic solution of problem is accomplished using the implicit time integration method. The convective terms due to mesh-material motion are taken into account via the convection equation. A robust and efficient mesh motion technique, that its equations need not to be solved at every time step, is employed in Eulerian phase. The mesh connectivity is preserved during the analysis. So, the successive remeshing of model is eliminated. When the dynamic fracture criterion is satisfied for crack growth, the presented algorithm allows the crack to advance by splitting the material particle at the crack tip. The dynamic energy release rate is calculated at each time step to determine dynamic stress intensity factor. The predicted results are compared with those obtained through the experimental study and remeshing technique cited in the literature.

@article{PijaudierCabot1995,
   abstract = {Non‐local models guaranty that finite element computations on strain softening materials remain sound up to failure from a theoretical and computational viewpoint. The non‐locality prevents strain localization with zero global dissipation of energy, and consequently finite element calculations converge upon mesh refinements to non‐zero width localization zones. One of the major drawbacks of these models is that the element size needed in order to capture the localization zone must be smaller than the internal length. Hence, the total number of degrees of freedom becomes rapidly prohibitive for most engineering applications and there is an obvious need for mesh adaptivity. This paper deals with the application of the arbitrary Lagrangian–Eulerian (ALE) formulation, well known in hydrodynamics and fluid–structure interaction problems, to transient strain localization in a non‐local damageable material. It is shown that the ALE formulation which is employed in large boundary motion problems can also be well suited for non‐linear transient analysis of softening materials where localization bands appear. The remeshing strategy is based on the equidistribution of an indicator that quantifies the interelement jump of a selected state variable. Two well known one‐dimensional examples illustrate the capabilities of this technique: the first one deals with localization due to a propagating wave in a bar, and the second one studies the wave propagation in a hollow sphere.

   abstract = {© 2015, Graveleau et al. Background: Contact mechanics involves models governed by inequality constraints. Even for the simplest contact problem, inequalities arise from the lack of information on the contact zone position. In addition to increasing the difficulty to solve such problems, an unknown contact zone makes it difficult to use an appropriate mesh and to represent efficiently phenomena on the contact zone boundary. Nevertheless these phenomena are often crucial to have an accurate representation of the problem such as weak discontinuity of the displacement. Methods: In this paper, we propose a method specifically designed to solve inequality constraint problems linked to an unknown domain without remeshing. In order to do so, level sets coupled with X-FEM is used to define the unknown domain and take into account the specific behavior at the contact zone boundary. The key idea of the method is to split the problem involving inequality constraints into two problems. In the first problem, the unknown domain is set and therefore it only involves equalities. Nevertheless, the constraints might be violated, meaning the set domain has to be changed. Then, the other problem is a shape optimization of this domain and leads to an updated set domain. These two problems are iterated up to convergence of the algorithm. Moreover, the addition of adhesion to the problem will be considered. Results: The studied case in this paper is a membrane in the context of small deformations. First, a 1D example will be given to illustrate the method with and without adhesion. Then 2D cases will be studied. Finally an example with an evolving load will be given. Comparison will be made with a classical active-set method. Conclusions: The ILS is proved to be an efficient method giving a convincing accuracy for the contact boundary without need of re-meshing. It is also able to naturally handle adhesion.},

The crack tip starts to move at the instant that it is struck by an incident wave. The finite element grid moves undeformed with the crack tip. The main result consists in the fact that the method of non-singular calibrated crack tip elements, in which the stress-intensity factor is determined from its statically calibrated ratio to the crack opening displacement in an adjacent node, is extended to dynamic problems with moving cracks, for both in-plane and anti-plane motions. The dependence of the calibration ratio on the crack tip velocity is established from previously developed analytical solutions for the near-tip displacement fields.

Many comparisons between experiments and FE computations of bird impacts onto aluminium riveted panels have shown that macroscopic plastic strains were not sufficiently developed (and localised) in the riveted shell FE in the impact area. Consequently, FE models never succeed in initialising and propagating the rupture in the sheet metal plates and along rivet rows as shown by experiments, without calibrating the input data (especially the damage and failure properties of the riveted shell FE). To model the assembly correctly, it appears necessary to investigate on FE techniques such as Hybrid-Trefftz finite element method (H-T FEM). Indeed, perforated FE plates developed for elastic problems, based on a Hybrid-Trefftz formulation, have been found in the open literature. Our purpose is to find a way to extend this formulation so that the super-element can be used for crashworthiness. To reach this aim, the main features of an elastic Hybrid-Trefftz plate are presented and are then followed by a discussion on the possible extensions.

Numerical results show that the weak and strong discontinuities in pressure with straight and circular interfaces are accurately reproduced by the constraints. Comparisons with the SUPG/PSPG (streamline upwind/pressure stabilizing Petrov-Galerkin) method without Lagrange multipliers validate the applicability and flexibility of the proposed constrained algorithm to model problems with quasi-static interfaces.},

The configurational force driving the damage front is non-local in the sense that it averages information over the thickness in the wake of the front. The computational and theoretical advantages of the new damage model are stressed. Numerical examples demonstrate the capability of the new model to initiate cracks and propagate them even in complex topological patterns (branching and merging for instance).},

   abstract = {We describe a method for discretizing planar C2-regular domains immersed in non-conforming triangulations. The method consists in constructing mappings from triangles in a background mesh to curvilinear ones that conform exactly to the immersed domain. Constructing such a map relies on a novel way of parameterizing the immersed boundary over a collection of nearby edges with its closest point projection. By interpolating the mappings to curvilinear triangles at select points, we recover isoparametric mappings for the immersed domain defined over the background mesh. Indeed, interpolating the constructed mappings just at the vertices of the background mesh yields a fast meshing algorithm that involves only perturbing a few vertices near the boundary. For the discretization of a curved domain to be robust, we have to impose restrictions on the background mesh. Conversely, these restrictions define a family of domains that can be discretized with a given background mesh. We then say that the background mesh is a universal mesh for such a family of domains. The notion of universal meshes is particularly useful in free/moving boundary problems because the same background mesh can serve as the universal mesh for the evolving domain for time intervals that are independent of the time step. Hence it facilitates a framework for finite element calculations over evolving domains while using a fixed background mesh. Furthermore, since the evolving geometry can be approximated with any desired order, numerical solutions can be computed with high-order accuracy. We demonstrate these ideas with various numerical examples.},

In the extended finite element method (FEM), the transition elements between the enriched and standard elements, which are generally referred as the blending, or partially enriched elements, are often crucial for a good performance of the local partition of unity enrichments. In these elements, the enrichment function cannot be reproduced exactly due to the lack of a partition of unity, and blending elements produce unwanted terms into the approximation that cannot be compensated by the standard final element part of the approximation. In this paper, some optimal X-FEM-type methods reported in literature are employed to study the performance of blending elements in large plastic deformation problems with weak discontinuities. Several numerical examples are solved using the standard X-FEM, the X-FEM with modified enrichment function, the hierarchical X-FEM and the corrected X-FEM technique, and the results are compared with an alternative intrinsic enrichment strategy in large deformation problems.},

   abstract = {This paper presents a three-dimensional, extrinsically enriched meshfree method for initiation, growth and coalescence of an arbitrary number of cracks in non-linear solids including large deformations, for statics and dynamics. The novelty of the methodology fashioned in this work is that only an extrinsic discontinuous enrichment and no near-tip/asymptotic enrichment is required. Instead, a Lagrange multiplier field is added along the crack front to close the crack along the front. This decreases the computational cost and removes difficulties involved with a branch enrichment. Numerical examples treated include the pull-out of a reinforcement bar from a concrete block, and a Taylor bar impact with very large deformation and fragmentation. The results are compared to experimental results, and other simulations from the literature, which shows the robustness and accuracy of the method. © 2007 Springer.},

   abstract = {CAD based shape optimization aims at finding the shapes of internal and external boundaries of a structural components. The method is able to improve the design of structures against various criteria such as restricted displacements, stress criteria, eigenfrequencies, etc. However, this technique has been quite unsuccessful in industrial applications because of the mesh management problems coming from the large shape modifications. The main technical problems stems from the sensitivity analysis requiring the calculation of the so-called velocity field related to mesh modifications. If 2D problems are quite well mastered, 3D solid and shell problems are difficult to handle in the most general way. It turns out that shape optimization remains generally quite fragile and delicate to use in industrial context. To circumvent the technical difficulties of the moving mesh problems, a couple of methods have been proposed such as the fictitious domain approach, the fixed grid finite elements and the projection methods. The present work relies on the application of the extended finite element method (X-FEM) to handle parametric shape optimization. The X-FEM method is naturally associated with the Level Set description of the geometry to provide an efficient and flexible treatment of problems involving moving boundaries or discontinuities. On the one hand, the method proposed benefits from the fixed mesh approach using X-FEM to prevent from mesh management difficulties. On the other hand, the Level Set description provides a smooth curves representation while being able to treat topology modifications naturally. In this thesis, we focus on the material-void and bi-material X-FEM elements for mechanical structures. The representation of the geometry is realized with a Level Set description. Basic shapes can be modeled from simple Level Set such as plane, circle, ... NURBS curves and surfaces that can be combined together using a Constructive Solid Geometry approach to represent complex geometries. The design variables of the optimization problem are the parameters of basic Level Set features or the NURBS control points. Classical global (compliance, eigenfrequencies, volume) and local responses (such as stress constraint) can be considered in the optimization problem that is solved using a mathematical programming approach with the CONLIN optimizer. The problem of the computation of the shape sensitivity analysis with X-FEM is carefully addressed and investigated using several original methods based on semi-analytical and analytical approaches that are developed. Academic examples are first considered to illustrate that the proposed method is able to tackle accurately shape optimization problems. Then, real life structures including 2D and 3D complex geometries illustrate the advantages and the drawbacks of using X-FEM and Level Set description for generalized shape optimization.},

In the XFEM, the approximate solution is locally enriched to capture discontinuities without requiring a mesh which conforms to the geometric features. One drawback of the XFEM is that an ill-conditioned system of equations results when the ratio of volumes on either side of the interface in an element is small. In this paper, to avoid this ill-conditioning, a simple and efficient scheme based on a geometric preconditioner and constraining degrees of freedom to zero for small intersections is proposed. This geometric preconditioner is computed from the nodal basis functions, and therefore may be constructed prior to building the system of equations. This feature and the low-cost of constructing the preconditioning matrix makes it well suited for nonlinear problems with fixed and moving interfaces.},

Offshore installations, in particular, are susceptible to fatigue failure due to their exposure to the combination of wind loads, wave loads and currents. In order to assess the safety of the components of these installations, the expected lifetime of the component needs to be estimated. The fatigue life is the sum of the number of loading cycles required for a fatigue crack to initiate, and the number of cycles required for the crack to propagate before sudden fracture occurs. Since analytical determination of the fatigue crack propagation life in real geometries is rarely viable, crack propagation problems are normally solved using some computational method. In this review the use of the finite element method (FEM) and the extended finite element method (XFEM) to model fatigue crack propagation is discussed. The basic techniques are presented, together with some of the recent developments.},

   abstract = {Numerical crack propagation schemes were augmented in an elegant manner by the X-FEM method. The use of special tip enrichment functions, as well as a discontinuous function along the sides of the crack allows one to do a complete crack analysis virtually without modifying the underlying mesh, which is of industrial interest, especially when a numerical model for crack propagation is desired. This paper improves the implementation of the X-FEM method for stress analysis around cracks in three ways. First, the enrichment strategy is revisited. The conventional approach uses a ‘topological’ enrichment (only the elements touching the front are enriched). We suggest a ‘geometrical’ enrichment in which a given domain size is enriched. The improvements obtained with this enrichment are discussed. Second, the conditioning of the X-FEM both for topological and geometrical enrichments is studied. A preconditioner is introduced so that ‘off the shelf’ iterative solver packages can be used and perform as well on X-FEM matrices as on standard FEM matrices. The preconditioner uses a local (nodal) Cholesky based decomposition. Third, the numerical integration scheme to build the X-FEM stiffness matrix is dramatically improved for tip enrichment functions by the use of an ad hoc integration scheme. A 2D benchmark problem is designed to show the improvements and the robustness. Copyright © 2005 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

Two techniques are used in synergy: a multiscale strategy based on a domain decomposition method to account for the crack's global and local effects efficiently, and a local enrichment technique (the X-FEM) to describe the geometry of the crack independently of the mesh. The focus of this study is the avoidance of meshing difficulties and the choice of an appropriate scale separation to make the strategy efficient. We show that the introduction of the crack's discontinuity both on the microscale and on the macroscale is essential for the numerical scalability of the domain decomposition method to remain unaffected by the presence of a crack. Thus, the convergence rate of the iterative solver is the same throughout the crack's propagation.},

The second contribution revisits the problem of the numerical integration of the stiffness operator when singular functions like the tip enrichment functions are used.

In order to estimate the approximation error in the usual energy norm, the underlying bilinear form is decomposed into a computable integral and two other terms which can be estimated from above using elementary tools of functional analysis. Two auxiliary parameter-functions are introduced to construct such a splitting and tune the resulting bound. If these functions are chosen in an optimal way, the exact energy norm of the error is recovered, which proves that the estimate is sharp. The presented methodology is completely independent of the numerical technique used to compute the approximate solution. In particular, it is applicable to approximations which fail to satisfy the Galerkin orthogonality, e.g. due to an inconsistent stabilization, flux limiting, low-order quadrature rules, round-off and iteration errors, etc. Moreover, the only constant that appears in the proposed error estimate is global and stems from the Friedrichs-Poincaré inequality.

We provide a similar analysis for f ≠ 0 and discuss the roles of f and g, which turn to be somewhat interchangeable in the low regularity case.

   abstract = {The overall properties of composites may be defined from the solution of some standard boundary value problem. For example, for elasticity, displacements consistent with a uniform strain throughout the composite may be prescribed on the boundary. The actual strain fluctuates but its mean takes the prescribed value and the object is to deduce the mean stress. For random composites, an ergodic hypothesis is invoked and the expectation value of the stress at some chosen point is sought instead. The problem so generated requires the solution of an integral equation. For a medium containing a dilute distribution of particles or fibres, expressions for the overall moduli as power series in the concentration c may be sought, by ensemble averaging the integral equation keeping one or more particles fixed. An infinite hierarchy of equations is generated in this way, which is solved by making an appropriate closure assumption, valid in the limit of low concentrations, at some stage: closing at the nth stage correctly estimates moduli up to terms of order cn. If such closure assumptions are made for high concentrations, they become no more than ad hoc approximations and yet, even the simplest, the “quasicrystalline approximation,” has been found to give estimates of overall moduli in agreement with those obtained from a “cell” approximation believed to generate reasonable results at any concentration. This is demonstrated via a formulation in terms of stress polarization and the associated variational principle, due to Hashin and Shtrikman. Allowance for higher order interactions is shown in many cases to yield bounds on the coefficients of c2 in the moduli and an example is worked out in detail.},

   abstract = {A new finite element formulation for convection dominated flows is developed. The basis of the formulation is the streamline upwind concept, which provides an accurate multidimensional generalization of optimal one-dimensional upwind schemes. When implemented as a consistent Petrov-Galerkin weighted residual method, it is shown that the new formulation is not subject to the artificial diffusion criticisms associated with many classical upwind methods. The accuracy of the streamline upwind/Petrov-Galerkin formulation for the linear advection diffusion equation is demonstrated on several numerical examples. The formulation is extended to the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. An efficient implicit pressure/explicit velocity transient algorithm is developed which accomodates several treatments of the incompressibility constraint and allows for multiple iterations within a time step. The effectiveness of the algorithm is demonstrated on the problem of vortex shedding from a circular cylinder at a Reynolds number of 100. © 1982.},

One key ingredient is the introduction of a fixed (absolute) configuration, relative to which both physical and (virtual) configurational and spatial changes can be described. Only quasistatic and isothermal conditions are considered in this paper. A variational framework is established for the rate of global energy dissipation (integrated over the whole material domain) due to the combined action of a (discrete) crack extension and continuum inelasticity, whereby the material time derivative of internal variables and the rate of crack extension are coupled. The classical assumption (previously adopted in the literature) is that there is no coupling, i.e. the internal variables are considered as fixed (material) fields just like an inhomogeneous material property. The other (extreme) assumption is that the internal variables fields are convected with the configurational motion due to the virtual crack extension. Both cases are investigated in this paper for a simple 2D example of an edge crack in a plate in a setting of small strains and hardening plasticity. In particular, we consider convergence issues from mesh refinement.},

Nevertheless, even if its use in the calculation of configurational forces is well-established, its peculiar properties were investigated only recently. Here, some new properties of this tensor are studied. In this way, it is assumed that the evolution of microscopic defects in the material can be predicted at the macroscopic scale by examining the components of the Eshelby stress tensor.More precisely, considering that defects can be modeled by material surfaces oriented in all possible directions and assuming that they are able to evolve in every possible directions, it is shown that the maximum amount of energy which can be released by defects evolution is partially contained in the tensor. In the special case of hyperelasticity, the corresponding optimization problem is established and solved for both isotropic and anisotropic materials. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2009.},

Our approach is based on the rigorous definition of the configurations of the body and on the physical significance of the configurational stress tensor.

   abstract = {Configurational forces and couples acting on a dynamically evolving fracture process region as well as their balance are studied with special emphasis to microstructure and dissipation. To be able to investigate fracture process regions preceding cracks of mode I, II and III we choose as underlying continuum model the polar and micropolar, respectively, continuum with dislocation motion on the microlevel. As point of departure balance of macroforces, balance of couples and balance of microforces acting on dislocations are postulated. Taking into account results of the second law of thermodynamics the stress power principle for dissipative processes is derived. Applying this principle to a fracture process region evolving dynamically in the reference configuration with variable rotational and crystallographic structure, the configurational forces and couples are derived generalizing the well-known Eshelby tensor. It is shown that the balance law of configurational forces and couples reflects the structure of the postulated balance laws on macro- and microlevel: the balance law of configurational forces and configurational couples are coupled by field variable, while the balance laws of configurational macro- and microforces are coupled only by the form of the free energy. They can be decoupled by corresponding constitutive assumption. Finally, it is shown that the second law of thermodynamics leads to the result that the generalized Eshelby tensor for micropolar continua with dislocation motion consists of a non-dissipative part, derivable from free and kinetic energy, and a dissipative part, derivable from a dissipation pseudo-potential. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Energy release rates are calculated directly from integral expressions evaluated over singular quarter‐point isoparametric elements surrounding the crack tip. Since the energy release rates are expressed in variational form, there is no need for the analyst to select a small finite crack extension to simulate a virtual crack extension. The method is shown to produce very accurate solutions even with fairly coarse element meshes. A similar technique for mixed‐mode fracture based on mutual potential energy release rates is described.

Conventional ALE formulations, which have been successfully applied to not only fluids but also solid materials with rate constitutive equations, are usually described in velocity-based variables. Thus, in the application of such formulations to hyperelasticity, the velocity needs to be integrated in the time variable to obtain the deformation gradient necessarily appearing in hyperelastic material modeling. However, such integration is expensive and difficult to evaluate precisely. From such aspects, we propose a new ALE finite element formulation which directly incorporates the total deformation to avoid integration of velocity-based variables and can deal with arbitrary mesh motion by considering the variation of geometric mappings. Some basic numerical results are also given to illustrate the validity of our formulation. © 1993.},

   abstract = {Experiments on the dynamic fracture of solids, liquids , conductors, and insulators that is caused by fast intense actions of environment or directed energy fluxes reveal a number of effects indicating a fundamental difference between the fast dynamic rupture (breakdown) of materials and a similar process under slow quasistatic actions. For example, one of the basic problems in testing the dynamic-strength properties of materials is associated with the dependence of the limiting characteristics on the duration, amplitude, and growth rate of an external action, as well as on a number of other factors. Whereas a critical value is a constant for a material in the static case, experimentally determined critical characteristics in dynamics are strongly unstable, and as a result, their behavior becomes unpredictable. The indicated (and some other) features of the behavior of materials subjected to pulsed actions are common for a number of seemingly quite different physical processes, such as dynamic fracture (starting cracks and splitting), cavitation in liquids, and electrical breakdown in solids. In this paper, we analyze examples illustrating typical dynamic effects inherent in the these processes. We propose a unified interpretation for the fracture of solids and liquids and electrical breakdown in insulators using the structural-time approach [1, 2] based on the concept of the fracture incubation time. CRITERION OF THE FRACTURE INCUBATION TIME The basic cause of difficulties in modeling the afore-mentioned effects of mechanical or electrical strength is the absence of an adequate limiting condition that determines the instant of rupture or breakdown. This problem can be solved by using both the structural mac-romechanics of fracture and the concept of the fracture incubation time, which represents the kinetic processes of the formation of macroscopic breaks [1, 2]. The above effects become essential for actions whose periods are comparable with the scale determined by the fracture incubation time associated with preparatory relaxation processes of developing microdefects in the material structure. The criterion of the fracture incubation time proposed in [1, 2] makes it possible to calculate effects of the unstable behavior of dynamic-strength characteristics. These effects are observed in experiments on the fracture of solids. This criterion can be generalized in the form of the condition (1) Here, F (t) is the intensity of a local force field causing the fracture of the medium, F s is the static limit of the local force field, and τ is the incubation time associated with the dynamics of a relaxation process preparing the break. The fracture time is defined as the time at which condition (1) becomes an equality. The parameter α characterizes the sensitivity of a material to the intensity of the force field causing fracture. By example of the mechanical break of a material, we now consider one of the possible methods of interpreting and determining the parameter τ. We assume that a standard sample made of a given material under tension is broken into two parts under the stress P arising at a certain time t = 0: F (t) = PH (t) , where H (t) is the Heaviside step function. In the case of quasi-brittle fracture, the material is unloaded, and the local stress at the break point decreases rapidly (but not instantaneously) from P to 0. In this case, the corresponding unloading wave is generated, propagates over the sample , and can be detected by well-known (e.g., interfero-metric) methods. The stress variation at the break point can be conditionally represented by the dependence σ (t) = P-Pf (t) , where the function f (t) varies from 0 to 1 within a certain time interval T. The case f (t) = H (t) corresponds to the classical theory of strength. In other 1 τ-F t' () F s-    α t' 1. ≤ d t τ-t ∫},

The simplest case to consider is that of elastomeric materials which can undergo large reversible deformations with negligible rate dependence. In this paper we develop a theory for modeling progressive damage and rupture of such materials. We extend the phase-field method, which is widely used to describe the damage and fracture of brittle materials, to elastomeric materials undergoing large deformations. A central feature of our theory is the recognition that the free energy of elastomers is not entirely entropic in nature — there is also an energetic contribution from the deformation of the bonds in the chains. It is the energetic part in the free energy which is the driving force for progressive damage and fracture.},

   abstract = {One of the distinguishing features of elastomeric materials, which consist of a network of flexible polymeric chains, is that the deformation response is dominated by changes in entropy. Accordingly, most classical theories of rubber-like elasticity consider only the entropy and neglect any changes in internal energy. On the other hand, the fracture of strongly cross-linked elastomers is essentially energy dominated, as argued in the well-known Lake–Thomas model for the toughness of elastomers. However, a single model unifying these two phenomena is still lacking. We provide a rational yet simple model for deformation and fracture of cross-linked polymers, based on two ingredients: (i) a non-Gaussian statistical mechanics model of polymer chains that accounts for the increase in energy due to the deformation of molecular bonds; (ii) a chain scission criterion based on the bond deformation energy attaining a critical value. Using this model, we can estimate the rupture stretch of elastomeric materials from fundamental quantities describing the polymer network. We use this model to relate the flaw sensitivity of elastomers to an intrinsic material length scale related to the network structure.},

To achieve this main objective, we first rigorously reformulate two-dimensional linear elastic dynamic fracture problems using variational methods and shape derivative techniques. The classical equation of motion governing a smoothly propagating crack tip follows by considering variations of a space-time action integral. We then give a variationally consistent framework of the dynamic gradient damage model. Owing to the analogies between the variational ingredients of these two models and under some basic assumptions concerning the damage band structuration, one obtains a generalized Griffith criterion which governs the crack tip evolution within the non-local damage model. Assuming further that the internal length is small compared to the dimension of the body, the previous criterion leads to the classical Griffith's law through a separation of scales between the outer linear elastic domain and the inner damage process zone.},

Introducing an internal-state variable that represents the local free-volume associated with certain metastable states, we are able to capture the highly non-linear stress-strain behavior that precedes the yield-peak and gives rise to post-yield strain softening. Our theory explicitly accounts for the dependence of the Helmholtz free energy on the plastic deformation in a thermodynamically consistent manner. This dependence leads directly to a backstress in the underlying flow rule, and allows us to model the rapid strain-hardening response after the initial yield-drop in monotonic deformations, as well as the Bauschinger-type reverse-yielding phenomena typically observed in amorphous polymeric solids upon unloading after large plastic deformations. We have implemented a special set of constitutive equations resulting from the general theory in a finite-element computer program. Using this finite-element program, we apply the specialized equations to model the large-deformation response of the amorphous polymeric solid polycarbonate, at ambient temperature and pressure.

In an attempt to correct this difficulty and to construct models that might exhibit realistic behavior, we have extended the CLN analysis to include dissipative mechanisms within the cohesive zone. We have succeeded to some extent in finding mathematically well posed systems; and we even have found a class of models for which a transition from stability to instability may occur at a nonzero crack speed via a Hopf bifurcation at a finite wavelength of the applied perturbation.

Here we propose a theoretical framework for the dynamic fracture of highly-deformable materials, in which the effects of a dynamic crack are treated with respect to the nonlinearly deformed (pre-stressed/strained), non-cracked, state of the material. Within this framework, we derive analytic and semi-analytic solutions for the near-tip deformation fields and energy release rates of dynamic cracks propagating in incompressible neo-Hookean solids under biaxial and uniaxial loading. We show that moderately large pre-stressing has a marked effect on the stress fields surrounding a crack's tip. We verify these predictions by performing extensive experiments on the fracture of soft brittle elastomers over a range of loading levels and propagation velocities, showing that the newly developed framework offers significantly better approximations to the measurements than standard approaches at moderately large levels of external loadings and high propagation velocities. This framework should be relevant to the failure analysis of soft and tough, yet brittle, materials.},

   abstract = {The elasticity of a solid can vary depending on its state of deformation. For example, metals will soften and polymers may stiffen as they are deformed to levels approaching failure. It is only when the deformation is infinitesimally small that elastic moduli can be considered constant, and hence the elasticity linear. Yet, many existing theories model fracture using linear elasticity, despite the fact that materials will experience extreme deformations at crack tips. Here we show by large-scale atomistic simulations that the elastic behaviour observed at large strains--hyperelasticity--can play a governing role in the dynamics of fracture, and that linear theory is incapable of fully capturing all fracture phenomena. We introduce the concept of a characteristic length scale for the energy flux near the crack tip, and demonstrate that the local hyperelastic wave speed governs the crack speed when the hyperelastic zone approaches this energy length scale.},

We extend this framework by deriving a weakly nonlinear fracture mechanics theory incorporating the leading nonlinear elastic corrections that must occur at high strains. This yields strain contributions "more-divergent" than $r^\{-1/2\}$ at a finite distance from the tip and logarithmic corrections to the parabolic crack tip opening displacement. In addition, a dynamic length-scale, associated with the nonlinear elastic zone, emerges naturally. The theory provides excellent agreement with recent near-tip measurements that can not be described in the LEFM framework.},

   abstract = {Configurational forces and couples acting on a dynamically evolving fracture process region as well as their balance are studied with special emphasis to microstructure and dissipation. To be able to investigate fracture process regions preceding cracks of mode I, II and III we choose as underlying continuum model the polar and micropolar, respectively, continuum with dislocation motion on the microlevel. As point of departure balance of macroforces, balance of couples and balance of microforces acting on dislocations are postulated. Taking into account results of the second law of thermodynamics the stress power principle for dissipative processes is derived. Applying this principle to a fracture process region evolving dynamically in the reference configuration with variable rotational and crystallographic structure, the configurational forces and couples are derived generalizing the well-known Eshelby tensor. It is shown that the balance law of configurational forces and couples reflects the structure of the postulated balance laws on macro- and microlevel: the balance law of configurational forces and configurational couples are coupled by field variable, while the balance laws of configurational macro- and microforces are coupled only by the form of the free energy. They can be decoupled by corresponding constitutive assumption. Finally, it is shown that the second law of thermodynamics leads to the result that the generalized Eshelby tensor for micropolar continua with dislocation motion consists of a non-dissipative part, derivable from free and kinetic energy, and a dissipative part, derivable from a dissipation pseudo-potential. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

First, the effect of a narrow zone of disintegrating material at the crack tip on opening displacement and on a finite stress distribution ahead of the tip is examined for elastic materials. Extension to viscoelastic media is then made. Although the undamaged portion of the continuum is assumed linear, no significant restrictions are placed on the nature of the zone of failing material at the crack tip and, therefore, this material may be highly nonlinear, rate-dependent, and even discontinuous. Finally, formulation of the problem is completed by introducing a local energy criterion of failure at the tip which is applicable to both constant and transient tip velocities.

Furthermore, efficient modelling of arbitrary crack growth by use of XFEM (extended finite element method) requires accurate knowledge of the asymptotic crack tip fields. In the present work, we perform an asymptotic analysis of the mechanical fields in the vicinity of a propagating mode I crack in rubber. Plane deformation is assumed, and the material model is based on the Langevin function, which accounts for the finite extensibility of polymer chains. The Langevin function is approximated by a polynomial, and only the term of the highest order contributes to the asymptotic solution. The crack is predicted to adopt a wedge-like shape, i.e. the crack faces will be straight lines. The angle of the wedge and the order of the stress singularity depend on the hardening of the strain energy function. The present analysis shows that in materials with a significant hardening, the inertia term in the equations of motion becomes negligible in the asymptotic analysis. Hence, there is no upper theoretical limit to the crack speed. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {Cracks, the major vehicle for material failure, tend to accelerate to high velocities in brittle materials. In three-dimensions, cracks generically undergo a micro-branching instability at about 40% of their sonic limiting velocity. Recent experiments showed that in sufficiently thin systems cracks unprecedentedly accelerate to nearly their limiting velocity without micro-branching, until they undergo an oscillatory instability. Despite their fundamental importance and apparent similarities to other instabilities in condensed-matter physics and materials science, these dynamic fracture instabilities remain poorly understood. They are not described by the classical theory of cracks, which assumes that linear elasticity is valid inside a stressed material and uses an extraneous local symmetry criterion to predict crack paths. Here we develop a model of two-dimensional dynamic brittle fracture capable of predicting arbitrary paths of ultra-high-speed cracks in the presence of elastic nonlinearity without extraneous criteria. We show, by extensive computations, that cracks undergo a dynamic oscillatory instability controlled by small-scale elastic nonlinearity near the crack tip. This instability occurs above a ultra-high critical velocity and features an intrinsic wavelength that increases proportionally to the ratio of the fracture energy to an elastic modulus, in quantitative agreement with experiments. This ratio emerges as a fundamental scaling length assumed to play no role in the classical theory of cracks, but shown here to strongly influence crack dynamics. Those results pave the way for resolving other long-standing puzzles in the failure of materials.},

The approach accounts for micromechanical based features of both elastic and viscoelastic bulk responses of idealized polymer net- works. To this end, the Bergstörm–Boyce model is considered to introduce hyperelastic and nonlinear finite viscoelastic responses. Moreover, the crack driving force and the crack driving direction are predicted by the material force approach. A consistent thermodynamic framework for the combined configurational motion in viscoelastic continua at finite strain regime is discussed. The fracture toughness of non-strain-crystallizing elastomers shows strong rate dependency and the energy release rate versus the rate of tearing to be a fundamental material property. Therefore, in this contri- bution, a dynamic fracture criterion, which is a function of the rate of crack growth, is shown to be adequate in numerical simulations. The use of the presented method enables to study fracture behaviour of any mate- rial nonlinearity within the implicit time integration. Main feature of the proposed algorithm is restructuring the overall discrete system by duplication of crack front DOFs based on minimization of the overall energy via the Griffith criterion.},

   abstract = {The plane strain problem of a half-plane crack in an unbounded elastic solid is considered. The faces of the crack are subjected to suddenly applied, equal but opposite concentrated normal forces which tend to separate the crack faces. The elastic wave propagation problem, which contains a characteristic length, is solved exactly by linear superposition over a fundamental solution arising from a particular problem in the dynamic theory of elastic dislocations. Attention is focused on the time-dependent stress intensity factor. For an applied load with step function time dependence, the stress intensity factor is negative from the time the first wave arrives at the crack tip until the arrival of the Rayleigh wave. At that instant, it takes on its appropriate static value, which is thereafter maintained. Generalizations are discussed for spatially distributed and/or time-varying normal impact loads. On considère le problème de la contrainte plane d'une crique d'un demi-plan dans un solide élastique non lié. Les faces de la crique sont soumises à des forces normales concentrées, appliquées brusquement, égales mais opposées, et qui tendent à séparer les faces de la crique. Le problème de la propagation de l'onde élastique, laquelle comporte une longueur caractéristique, est résolu exactement par superposition linéaire sur une solution fondamentale provenant d'un problème particulier dans la théorie dynamique de dislocations élastiques. L'attention est portée sur le facteur d'intensité de la contrainte dépendant du temps. Peur une charge appliquée dépendant du temps par une fonction échelon, le facteur d'intensité de contrainte est négatif depuis le moment où la première onde arrive à l'extrémité de la crique jusqu'à l'arrivée de l'onde de Rayleigh. A cet instant, ce facteur prend sa valeur statique appropriée, qui est ensuite maintenue. Des généralisations sont étudiées pour des chocs normaux distribués spatialement et/ou variant dans le temps. Das ebene Spannungsproblem eines halbebenen Risses in einem unbegrenzten elastischen Festkörper wird untersucht. Die Rissoberflächen werden gleichen, aber entgegengesetzt konzentrierten normalen Kräften, plötzlich angewandt, unterworfen, die dazu neigen, die Rissoberflächen zu teilen. Das elastische Wellenfortpflanzungsproblem, das eine charakteristische Länge enthält, wird genau durch lineare Überlagerung über eine fundamentale Lösung gelöst, die von einem besonderen Problem in der dynamischen Theorie elastischer Verlagerungen stammt. Die Aufmerksamkeit wird auf den zeitabhängigen Spannungsintensitätsfaktor gerichtet. Für eine angewandte Last mit Stufenfunktionszeitabhängigkeit ist der Spannungsintensitätsfaktor negativ von der Zeit, wenn die erste Welle an der Risspitze ankommt, bis die Rayleigh-Welle ankommt. In diesem Augenblick nimmt er seinen entsprechenden statischen Wert an, der nachher aufrechterhalten wird. Verallgemeinerungen werden für räumlich verteilte und/oder zeitveränderliche normale Stossbelastungen besprochen. Viene considerato il problema della sollecitazione piana di una fenditura semipiana in un solido elastico illimitato. Le facce della fenditura vengono assoggettate a forze normali concentrate uguali ed opposte, applicate improvvisamente. Il problema della propagazione di un'onda elastica, che contiene una lunghezza caratteristica, viene risolto in modo esatto a mezzo di superimposizione lineare sopra una soluzione fondamentale derivante da un problema particolare della teoria dinamica delle dislocazioni elastiche. Viene data particolare attenzione al fattore d'intensità della sollecitazione che è una funzione del tempo. Con un carico applicato secondo una funzione a gradino del tempo, il fattore d'intensità della sollecitazione è negativo dal momento in cui la prima onda arriva alla punta della fenditura sino al momento dell'arrivo dell'onda de Rayleigh. In questo istante preciso assume il suo valore statico appropriato, che viene quindi mantenuto. Vengono discussi i casi generali dei carichi spaziali distribuiti e/o dei carichi d'urto perpendicolare variabili nel tempo. p;a;y;y;мo;t;p;e;нa; пp;o;блe;мa; плo;y;кo;й дe;фo;p;мa;ции v; y;лc;khcy;a;e; пo;лc;плo;y;кo;y;t;нo;й t;p;e;щины v; нe;o;гp;a;ниkhcy;e;ннo;м, c;пp;c;гo;м, t;v;e;p;дo;м t;e;лe;.

   abstract = {The analysis of dynamic crack problems often leads to results of such complexity that their physical significance cannot readily be apprehended; one must generally have recourse to ad hoc approximations, or to a numerical evaluation of the solutions, before such results can be interpreted. We present in this paper a more radical approximation in the form of an 'approximate kernel’ of the type first considered by Koiter in conjunction with the Wiener-Hopf technique. The approximate solutions to which this leads are compared with the exact solutions for a few basic problems concerning the elastic response to stationary, or moving, point forces applied to the faces of a semi-infinite crack. It is clear that all the essential features of the exact solutions are retained, and of course the approximate solutions are considerably simpler in form. The use of approximate kernels is not tied to the use of the Wiener-Hopf technique: they can also be used in con­junction with a method due to W. E. Williams, which is in fact much better suited to the analysis of crack problems. It is shown that the approximate kernel can also be used to simplify Kostrov’s solution of the arbitrarily moving crack problem and the analysis of crack problems in linear viscoelasticity.},

   abstract = {Aparticular motion of a half-plane crack in an elastic solid subjected to general loading is considered. The loading is prescribed so that the mode of deformation of the crack is the plane-strain opening mode. The crack is initially at rest and then, at a certain instant, begins to move with a constant velocity which is less than the Rayleigh wave speed. A fundamental solution is derived for particular loading on the body which makes it possible to obtain the solution for the complete dynamic stress field due to crack extension by linear superposition. The details of the solution are worked out for the dynamic stress intensity factor for the moving crack. It is found that the stress intensity factor varies almost linearly with the crack speed, from the static value at zero speed to zero at the Rayleigh wave speed. Some numerical results are also presented for the shape of the crack tip as a function of crack speed. Finally, the energy-release rate of the moving crack tip is plotted as a function of crack-tip speed.},

The material constitutive relation is that of an isotropic hyperelastic solid. The cohesive surface constitutive relation introduces a characteristic length into the formulation. The resistance to crack initiation and the crack speed history are predicted without invoking any additional failure criterion. Finite-strain transient analyses are carried out, with a focus on the relation between the increase in fracture energy with crack speed and the increase in surface area due to crack branching. The numerical results show that, even with a fixed work of separation per unit area, there is a substantial increase in fracture energy with increasing crack speed. This arises from an increase in fracture surface area due to crack branching. The computational results are in good agreement with experimental observations in Sharon et al (1996).},

   abstract = {The focus here is the growth of a planar crack in a brittle material under two dimensional plane strain conditions. The stress field surrounding the crack edge is presumed to be an elastic stress intensity factor field, or K-field, as is characteristic of such systems. However, as the observation point within the K-field approaches the crack edge, that field gradually gives way to a zone of material separation that is coplanar with the crack and that is characterized as a region of chemical bond breaking. The separation zone is spanned by a large number of identical atomic or molecular bonds resisting the influence of the surrounding stress field. The trailing edge of that zone coincides with the physical crack edge. By describing the collective response of these bonds in terms of the behavior of a generic bond and the statistical concept of survival probability, the process of material separation is followed to its end with no further requirement of a material failure condition. In this way, the physical process of material separation is related directly to the commonly measured fracture parameters for brittle materials.},

   abstract = {This paper concerns the propagation of impact-generated tensile waves in a one-dimensional bar made of a rubberlike material. Because the stress-strain curve changes from concave to convex as the strain increases, the governing quasi-linear system of partial differential equations, though hyperbolic, fails to be "genuinely nonlinear" so that the standard form of the boundary-initial value problem corresponding to impact is not well-posed at all levels of loading. When the problem fails to be well-posed, it does so by exhibiting a massive loss of uniqueness, even though an entropy-like dissipation inequality is in force. Because the breakdown in uniqueness is reminiscent of a similar phenomenon that occurs in continuum-mechanical models for impact-induced phase transitions, a mathematically suitable, though physically unmotivated, supplementary selection mechanism for determining the solution naturally suggests itself. We describe in detail the solutions determined by two special forms of this selection mechanism, and we show that these two solutions provide bounds on the impact response, regardless of the selection principle used.},

We consider a pre-strained plate problem, the homogeneous case of which has been widely studied both experimentally and numerically. This setup is used to isolate the effects of the elastic field resulting from pre-straining and stress wave interactions throughout the crack propagation by adding stiffer and denser regions in the plate. While the crack tip is pushed away by stiffer inclusions, it is attracted to the denser ones. With the presence of denser media, only a portion of the total elastic energy in the system is effectively used to drive crack propagation, leading to a drop in the velocity of its tip in comparison to the homogeneous case. The crack velocity is shown to be an invalid criterion for crack branching. Instead, we introduce an effective stored energy to analyze the crack velocity and the emergence of crack branching instabilities.},

   abstract = {Dynamic crack growth is analysed numerically for a plane strain block with an initial central crack subject to tensile loading. The continuum is characterized by a material constitutive law that relates stress and strain, and by a relation between the tractions and displacement jumps across a specified set of cohesive surfaces. The material constitutive relation is that of an isotropic hyperelastic solid. The cohesive surface constitutive relation allows for the creation of new free surface and dimensional considerations introduce a characteristic length into the formulation. Full transient analyses are carried out. Crack branching emerges as a natural outcome of the initial-boundary value problem solution, without any ad hoc assumption regarding branching criteria. Coarse mesh calculations are used to explore various qualitative features such as the effect of impact velocity on crack branching, and the effect of an inhomogeneity in strength, as in crack growth along or up to an interface. The effect of cohesive surface orientation on crack path is also explored, and for a range of orientations zigzag crack growth precedes crack branching. Finer mesh calculations are carried out where crack growth is confined to the initial crack plane. The crack accelerates and then grows at a constant speed that, for high impact velocities, can exceed the Rayleigh wave speed. This is due to the finite strength of the cohesive surfaces. A fine mesh calculation is also carried out where the path of crack growth is not constrained. The crack speed reaches about 45% of the Rayleigh wave speed, then the crack speed begins to oscillate and crack branching at an angle of about 29° from the initial crack plane occurs. The numerical results are at least qualitatively in accord with a wide variety of experimental observations on fast crack growth in brittle solids. © 1994.},

Specific numerical results for the variation of the stress intensity factor with crack speed are presented for the three-parameter viscoelastic solid.

   abstract = {Rationale: Aneurysm and dissection of the ascending thoracic aorta are the main cardiovascular complications of Marfan syndrome (MFS) resulting in premature death. Studies using mouse models of MFS have shown that activation of transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) and the concomitant upregulation of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) contribute to aneurysm development. Our previous study showed that doxycycline delayed aneurysm rupture in a mouse model of MFS, Fbn1mgR/mgR. Losartan has been shown to prevent aneurysms in another mouse model of MFS, Fbn1C1039G/+, through inhibition of the Erk1/2 pathway. However, the role of MMP-2 in MFS and effect of losartan on the lifespan of MFS mice remain unknown. Objective: We investigated the role of MMP-2 in MFS and compared the effects of losartan and doxycycline on aortic dilatation and survival in Fbn1mgR/mgR mice. Methods and Results: By life table analysis, we found that losartan and doxycycline improved the survival of Fbn1 mice. Gelatin zymography and Western blot data showed that only doxycycline inhibited MMP-2 expression, whereas both drugs decreased Erk1/2 phosphorylation. When combined, only one of nine mice died within the 30-week study; aortic histology and diameter were normalized and the effects on Smad2 phosphorylation was additive. To further explore the role of MMP-2 in MFS, we created MMP-2-deficient Fbn1mgR/mgR mice. MMP-2 deletion inhibited activation of TGF-β and phosphorylation of Erk1/2 and Smad2 and prolonged the lifespan of the mice. Conclusions: These studies demonstrated that inhibition of MMP-2 by doxycycline delayed the manifestations of MFS, in part, through its ability to decrease active TGF-β and the noncanonical signaling cascade downstream of TGF-β. This study further suggested that targeting TGF-β signaling at different points might be a more effective strategy for inhibiting disease progression. © 2012 American Heart Association, Inc.},

Second, we use the Wiener-Hopf technique to find the stress fields surrounding the crack. The energy is computed exactly. Almost all of the computation can be accomplished without carrying out the Wiener-Hopf decomposition explicitly. We describe a numerical technique by which to perform the Wiener-Hopf decomposition when needed. Finally, an adiabatic argument allows one to deduce an equation of motion for the crack.

   abstract = {The Wiener–Hopf technique is a powerful tool for constructing analytic solutions for a wide range of problems in physics and engineering. The key step in its application is solution of the Riemann–Hilbert problem, which consists of finding a piece-wise analytic (vector-) func- tion in the complex plane for a specified behavior of its discontinuities. In this dissertation, the applied theory of vector Riemann–Hilbert problems is reviewed. The analytical solu- tion representing the problem on a Riemann surface, and a numerical solution that reduces the problem to singular integral equations, are considered, as well as a combination of the numerical and analytical techniques (partial Wiener–Hopf factorization) is proposed. In this work, we begin with a brief survey of the Riemann–Hilbert problem: constructing solution of the scalar Riemann–Hilbert problem for a class of H¨ older continuous functions; considering classes of matrices that admit the closed-form solution of the vector Riemann– Hilbert problem; discussing numerical and analytical techniques of constructing solutions of vector Riemann–Hilbert problems. We continue with applications of the Wiener–Hopf technique to problems of Dynamic fracture mechanics: reviewing well-known solutions to problems on propagation of a semi- infinite crack in an unbounded plane in the cases of a stationary crack, a crack propagating at a constant speed, and a crack propagating at a non-uniform arbitrary speed. Based on those, we derive solutions to new problems on a semi-infinite crack propagation in a half- plane (steady-state and transient problems for subsonic speeds) as well as in a composite strip (for intersonic speeds). These latter results are new and were first derived by Y. Antipov and the author.},

   abstract = {The tendancy of a crack to extend under applied loads is governed by the cohesive forces acting near the crack tip. The crack-extension criteria of Griffith and Barenblatt take account of the cohesive forces in rather different ways, but are both of the same form. Therefore, if they are to agree, the surface energy T appearing in the Griffith criterion must be related in a definite way to Barenblatt's modulus of cohesion K. It is shown in this paper, from a detailed consideration of the cohesive forces, that the required relationship holds, in an asymptotic sense, if the forces act only over a short range; this is true in practice. Extension of the analysis to uniformly moving cracks then shows that K is a function of velocity, even for a perfectly elastic-brittle body. This has not been noted previously. Finally, the relative advantages of the two formulations are compared.},

The problem is reduced to the solution of the Riemann-Hilbert problem by application of the Schwarz-Christoffel transformation and the theory of complex functions. Closed-form solutions are obtained for two cases of practical interest: (1) the boundaries of the strip are clamped and displaced in equal and opposite directions causing a tearing motion along the leading edge of the crack and (2) the crack is sheared longitudinally by a pair of concentrated forces moving with the crack while the strip boundaries are free of tractions. In both cases, the effect of strip width on the dynamic stresses is examined. A dynamic crack extension force is defined by a line integral the value of which is independent of the path of integration and requires only a knowledge of the local stress and displacement fields. The information gained in this study is useful in that it can assist interpretation of results from dynamic experiments on moving cracks.},

   abstract = {Abstract Material failure occurs at the small scales in the immediate vicinity of the tip of a crack. Due to its generally microscopic\nsize and the typically high crack propagation velocity, direct observation of the dynamic behavior in this highly deformed\nregion has been prohibitively difficult. Here we present direct measurements of the deformation surrounding the tip of dynamic\nmode I cracks propagating in brittle elastomers at velocities ranging from 0.2 to \{0.8C\}\n\ns\n. Both the detailed fracture dynamics and fractography of these materials are identical to that of standard brittle amorphous\nmaterials such as soda-lime glass. These measurements demonstrate how Linear Elastic Fracture Mechanics \{(LEFM)\} breaks down\nnear the tip of a crack. This breakdown is quantitatively described by extending \{LEFM\} to the weakly nonlinear regime, by considering\nnonlinear elastic constitutive laws up to second order in the displacement-gradients. The theory predicts that, at scales\nwithin a dynamic lengthscale ℓ\n\nnl\nfrom the tip of a single crack, significant logr displacements and 1/r displacement-gradient contributions arise, and provides excellent quantitative agreement with the measured near-tip deformation.\nAs ℓ\n\nnl\nis consistent with lengthscales that appear in crack tip instabilities, this “weakly nonlinear fracture mechanics” framework\nmay serve as a springboard for the development of a comprehensive theory of fracture dynamics.},

   abstract = {Crack propagation is the basic mechanism of materials failure. Experiments on dynamic fracture in brittle amorphous materials have produced results' that agree with theoretical predictions for single-crack motion at very low velocities. But numerous apparent discrepancies with theory have been observed(2-4) at higher velocities. In particular, the maximum crack velocities attained in amorphous materials are far slower than the predicted asymptotic value, v(R) (ref. 3). Beyond a critical velocity, v(c) approximate to 0.4v(R), an intrinsic instability has been observed(5) in which a multiple-crack state is formed by repetitive, frustrated micro-branching events. These cause velocity oscillations and may explain the apparent anomaly. Here we report measurements of dynamic fracture in a brittle, amorphous material that are in quantitative agreement with the theoretical single-crack equation of motion, from the initial stages of propagation up to v(c). Beyond v(c), agreement breaks down owing to the appearance of the multiple-crack ensemble. But in this regime, the micro-branching process can momentarily produce a single-crack state which instantaneously attains its predicted single-crack velocity, for velocities up to 0.9v(R). Our results therefore confirm the validity of the single-crack continuum theory of elastic brittle fracture even in the dynamical regime where the crack morphology is complex.},

   abstract = {The theoretical understanding of the fracture mechanics of rubber is not as well developed as for other engineering materials, such as metals. The present study is intended to further the understanding of the dissipative processes that take place in rubber in the vicinity of a propagating crack tip. This dissipation contributes significantly to the total fracture toughness of the rubber and is therefore of great interest from a fracture mechanics point of view. To study this, a computational framework for analysing high-speed crack growth in a biaxially stretched rubber under plane stress is therefore formulated. The main purpose is to investigate the energy release rates required for crack propagation under different modes of biaxial stretching. The results show, that inertia comes into play when the crack speed exceeds about 50m/s. The total work of fracture by far exceeds the surface energy consumed at the very crack tip, and the difference must be attributed to dissipative damage processes in the vicinity of the crack tip. The size of this damage/dissipation zone is expected to be a few millimetres.},

We study the contribution to the crack propagation energy (per unit area) G from the viscoelastic deformations of the rubber in front of the propagating crack tip. We show that G takes the standard form G(v, T) = G 0 [1 + f (v, T)] where G 0 is associated with the (complex) bond-breaking processes at the crack tip while f (v, T) is determined by the viscoelastic energy dissipation in front of the crack tip. As applications, we discuss the role of crack propagation for adhesion, rolling resistance and sliding friction for smooth surfaces, and for rubber wear.

Much less is known about their performance under blast loading conditions, as until recently there was very little written in the literature on this subject. This chapter reviews experimental and numerical studies that focus on the blast response of FMLs manufactured from aluminium alloy and glass fiber-reinforced polymer layers. Herein, the difference in response to localized and uniformly distributed blast loading are reviewed, application of nondimensional analysis techniques used for steel are described, and any potential advantages of FMLs over the equivalent areal density metal panels are highlighted. © 2010 Springer-Verlag US.},

   abstract = {The fracture behavior of elastomers has been studied in the high speed region immediately above a transition region where a change in the nature of the fracture surface occurs. A video camera operating at up to 6000 frames/s was used to follow the progress of failure. The test pieces employed were of the pure shear or tensile strip (with edge crack) varieties employed in earlier tear studies; in orderto attain the high energy release rates required they were usually pre-strained and then cut to initiate the crack growth. The materials studied included various strain crystallizing and non-crystallizing elastomers, with different glass-transition temperatures, including natural rubber in normal, cis-trans isomerized or partially-epoxidized forms, a butadiene-acrylonitrile copolymer, a styrene-butadiene copolymer and ethylene-propylene co- and ter-polymers. The use of a fracture mechanics approach based on the strain energy release rate enables results for different test piece geometries to be brought into agreement in the region above the transition. Fracture energies in this region correlate well with viscoelastic properties, but the potential for strain crystallization to strengthen is not exhibited. This is presumably because at the high failure rates involved, the loading time at the crack tip is insufficient to allow significant crystallization to occur. The correlation with viscoelastic behavior suggests that the material around the propagating tip is still essentially rubbery in its behavior, although the fracture surfaces in the high speed region have a smooth, "glassy" appearance. Further evidence of this is provided by effects of crosslink type and density and filler type and loading, where again the effects seen in the high speed failure region parallel those observed below the transition. An effect of thickness on fracture properties appears to be absent in the high speed region, by contrast with behavior at lower energies and at the transition itself. This supports the view that the fracture surface roughness that develops in the lower energy region is due to the initiation of a process akin to cavitation by through-the-thickness stresses near the crack tip. The transition is found to vary with pressure and temperature, as well as thickness, in a way that does not correlate with viscoelastic changes but may reflect changes in the through-the-thickness stresses. The existence of a limiting crack speed is illustrated and discussed. Fracture under large biaxial deformations, where higher crack speeds are observed, will be discussed in part II.},

   abstract = {Classical fracture mechanics applied to a viscoelastic material states that the critical stress-intensity factor at which the crack propagates depends on the instantaneous elastic modulus of the solid, and provides no mechanism for a speed dependence of the apparent surface energy. This suggests that any speed dependence must be because surface energy itself is speed-dependant. Schapery (1975) has explained how by using the Barenblatt concept of fracture mechanics, involving surface forces instead of surface energy alone, a dependence of the apparent surface energy on the crack speed is found. Here, Schapery's principles are applied to the particular case of a Maugis–Dugdale surface force law and a three-element viscoelastic solid to find the complete dependence of the apparent surface energy, both in fracture and in crack healing, on the crack velocity. To a good approximation, the apparent surface energy in crack healing is the reciprocal of the energy for fracture. Simple approximate equations relating the crack speed to the stress-intensity factor are given.},

   abstract = {The fracture of brittle amorphous materials is an especially challenging problem, because the way a large object shatters is intimately tied to details of cohesion at microscopic scales. This subject has been plagued by conceptual puzzles, and to make matters worse, experiments seemed to contradict the most firmly established theories. In this review, we will show that the theory and experiments fit within a coherent picture where dynamic instabilities of a crack tip play a crucial role. To accomplish this task, we first summarize the central results of linear elastic dynamic fracture mechanics, an elegant and powerful description of crack motion from the continuum perspective. We point out that this theory is unable to make predictions without additional input, information that must come either from experiment, or from other types of theories. We then proceed to discuss some of the most important experimental observations, and the methods that were used to obtain the them. Once the flux of energy to a crack tip passes a critical value, the crack becomes unstable, and it propagates in increasingly complicated ways. As a result, the crack cannot travel as quickly as theory had supposed, fracture surfaces become rough, it begins to branch and radiate sound, and the energy cost for crack motion increases considerably. All these phenomena are perfectly consistent with the continuum theory, but are not described by it. Therefore, we close the review with an account of theoretical and numerical work that attempts to explain the instabilities. Currently, the experimental understanding of crack tip instabilities in brittle amorphous materials is fairly detailed. We also have a detailed theoretical understanding of crack tip instabilities in crystals, reproducing qualitatively many features of the experiments, while numerical work is beginning to make the missing connections between experiment and theory.},

Velocity measurements with resolution an order of magnitude better than previous experiments reveal the existence of a critical velocity (330 +/- 30 m/s) at which the velocity of the crack tip begins to oscillate, the dynamics of the crack abruptly change, and a periodic pattern is formed on the crack surface. Beyond the critical point the amplitude of the oscillations depends linearly on the mean velocity of the crack. The existence of this instability may explain the failure of theoretical predictions of crack dynamics and provides a mechanism for the enhanced dissipation observed experimentally in the fracture of brittle materials.},

   abstract = {Several strip band fracture tests have been performed with rubber toughened polymethylmethacrylate (RT-PMMA) samples. Using different types of profilometer, the precise amounts of created surfaces for different locations along the fracture were measured both before and after branching at different scales. It was observed that the fluctuations of the dynamic fracture energy that could be of the order of 300%, are well explained by the fluctuations of the actual amount of created surface when the fracture roughness is sampled at a scale of the order of 0.1. μm. This study shows that the classic approach, which approximates the amount of created surface during propagation as a flat rectangle defined as the sample thickness multiplied by the crack length, is not appropriate for a convenient estimate of fracture energy. Indeed, it is shown that the real 3D topography of the created surface has to be included in the energy balance to quantify an intrinsic material fracture energy. If not, fracture energy can be significantly underestimated. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

Unlike the classical approach of determining the steady state solutions for imposed constant speed of crack propagation, here the fracture criterion is imposed along with the formulation of the boundary-initial value problem and the coupled equations are solved numerically to determine the generation and growth of the fracture process zone as well as the crack tip.

The morphology of the fracture surface is examined in detail in four polymers: polymethylmethacrylate, Solithane-113, Homalite-100 and poly-carbonate. The fracture surface markings are examined to determine the micromechanisms of fracture. This examination reveals clearly that the operative micromechanism that governs dynamic fracture in brittle materials is the nucleation, growth and coalescence of microcracks. Following a quantitative characterization of the microcracking patterns, a very simple nucleation and growth model is then put forward. Imposing nucleation and growth criteria based on the experimental observations, the simulation recreates the experimental observations, not only of the microscope surface features, but also of the macroscopic behavior such as the constancy of the crack speed.},

   abstract = {A finite element model of a plate, which contains an initial crack subjected to a rapid loading at its faces, is investigated. A cell model of the prospective process region is adopted. The cell size is assumed to represent some characteristic intrinsic material length. The size of the process region is not predetermined but depends at every time on the number of cells that have reached a state characteristic for the process region i.e. essentially instability if load control would prevail. Outside the process region the material is assumed to be linearly elastic. For low loading magnitudes the simulations show a rather long period of crack acceleration. but at higher loads this period is short or even not detectable, and a constant terminal velocity, significantly lower than the Rayleigh wave velocity, is reached. At lower loads both the energy release rate and the extension of the process region stay rather constant, but at higher loads they increase considerably with time, even though the crack tip velocity stays constant. Thus it appears that a tendency towards increased energy flow to the process region is met by increased size of this region, and thereby increased energy dissipation per unit of crack growth, rather than by increased crack edge velocity. The process region may finally occupy several cell rows, and the control of the process region by the characteristic length is thus lost. This can explain the apparent loss of the unique relation between stress intensity factor and crack edge velocity at high crack velocities. In some simulations branching was obtained. The results from the simulations showed qualitative agreement with some recent experimental results e.g. those by Ravi-Chandar.},

This problem has been investigated by a number of authors, starting with Mott [1], but it was not until the paper by Broberg [2] that it was treated as a problem of the dynamic theory of elasticity. Broberg, however, neglected the effect of cohesive forces, and for this reason came to the conclusion that the uniform propagation of cracks can take place only at a velocity equal to the velocity of propagation of Rayleigh surface waves: at any other velocity an uncompensated singularity occurs in the stress field at the end of the crack. The present paper investigates on the basis of certain assumptions the effect of cohesive forces and derives an equation which defines the velocity of propagation of a crack in terms of the applied stress. It is shown that for every material there is a certain minimum velocity of stable uniform crack propagation. It is also shown that the velocity of stable propagation of a crack increases with increase in the splitting force and tends to the Rayleigh velocity: it would appear that in isotropic bodies the formation of a regime of uniform propagation at the Rayleigh velocity is prevented by the occurrence of branching of the crack. © 1962.},

First, the effect of a narrow zone of disintegrating material at the crack tip on opening displacement and on a finite stress distribution ahead of the tip is examined for elastic materials. Extension to viscoelastic media is then made. Although the undamaged portion of the continuum is assumed linear, no significant restrictions are placed on the nature of the zone of failing material at the crack tip and, therefore, this material may be highly nonlinear, rate-dependent, and even discontinuous. Finally, formulation of the problem is completed by introducing a local energy criterion of failure at the tip which is applicable to both constant and transient tip velocities. Parts II–IV, to appear in succeeding issues, will cover approximate methods of analysis and several applications of the theory.},

   abstract = {In the present paper, dynamic crack propagation in rubber is analyzed numerically using the finite element method. The problem of a suddenly initiated crack at the center of stretched sheet is studied under plane stress conditions. A nonlinear finite element analysis using implicit time integration scheme is used. The bulk material behavior is described by finite-viscoelasticity theory and the fracture separation process is characterized using a cohesive zone model with a bilinear traction-separation law. Hence, the numerical model is able to model and predict the different contributions to the fracture toughness, i.e. the surface energy, viscoelastic dissipation, and inertia effects. The separation work per unit area and the strength of the cohesive zone have been parameterized, and their influence on the separation process has been investigated. A steadily propagating crack is obtained and the corresponding crack tip position and velocity history as well as the steady crack propagation velocity are evaluated and compared with experimental data. A minimum threshold stretch of 3.0 is required for crack propagation. The numerical model is able to predict the dynamic crack growth. It appears that the strength and the surface energy vary with the crack speed. Finally, the maximum principal stretch and stress distribution around steadily propagation crack tip suggest that crystallization and cavity formation may take place.},

The analysis is based on the fully nonlinear equilibrium theory of incompressible hyperelastic solids. We show that the dominant singularity of the near tip stress field is governed by the asymptotic solution of a linear second order ordinary differential equation. Our method is applicable to any hyperelastic material with a smooth work function that depends only on the trace of the CauchyGreen tensor and is particularly useful for materials that exhibit severe strain hardening. We apply this method to study two types of soft materials: generalized neo-Hookean solids and a solid that hardens exponentially. For the generalized neo-Hookean solids, our method is able to resolve a difficulty in the previous work by Geubelle and Knauss (1994a).

@article{Jia2012,
   abstract = {Continuum mechanics predicts that the propagation speed of non-equilibrium information in solids is limited by the longitudinal wave speed, so is crack propagation. However, solids are essentially discrete systems. In this paper, via theoretical analysis and numerical simulations, it is demonstrated in a straightforward way that non-equilibrium disturbance (e.g. force, displacement, energy, and so on) can propagate at a supersonic speed in discrete systems, although the magnitude of the disturbance attenuates very quickly. In dynamic fracture, a cascade of atomic-bond breaking events provides an amplification mechanism to counterbalance the attenuation of the disturbance. Therefore, supersonic crack propagation can be realized in a domino way. Another key factor for supersonic crack propagation is to ensure sufficient energy flowing into the crack tip. Since most energy can only be transferred at a speed limited by the longitudinal wave speed, the conditions for the occurrence of supersonic crack propagation are not easily met in most situations, unless there is high pre-stored energy along the crack path or continuous energy supply from the loading concomitantly moving with the crack tip. A quantitative relation between supersonic crack propagation speed and material properties and parameters is given, which implies that knowing all the classical macroscopic quantities is not enough in determining the supersonic crack propagation speed, and the microstructure does play a role. Moreover, it is interesting to note that fracture toughness affects the crack propagation speed in the subsonic regime, but not in the supersonic regime, because the deformation/stress is uniform in front of a supersonic crack where strength criterion dominates.},

In this study, both surface and bulk cohesive formulations are presented for modeling brittle fracture, detailing the derivation of the formulations, ®tting relations, and providing a critical assessment of their capabilities in numerical simulations of fracture. Due to their inherent adaptivity and robustness under severe deformation, meshfree methods are especially well suited to modeling fracture behavior. Described are the applications of meshfree methods to both bulk and surface approaches to cohesive modeling. Numerical examples are provided to highlight the capabilities and shortcomings of the methods in order to identify which approaches are best suited to modeling dierent types of fracture phenomena.

We focus on how stresses and strains are localized near the fracture plane and how elastic energy can flow from the bulk of the material to the crack tip. Adhesion of pressure-sensitive-adhesives, fracture of gels and rubbers are specifically addressed and the key concepts are pointed out. We define the important length scales in the problem and in particular the elasto-adhesive length Γ/E where Γ is the fracture energy and E is the elastic modulus, and how the ratio between sample size and Γ/E controls the fracture mechanisms. Theoretical concepts bridging solid mechanics and polymer physics are rationalized and illustrated by micromechanical experiments and mechanisms of fracture are described in detail.

   abstract = {A rapidly moving crack in a brittle material is often idealized as a one-dimensional object with a singular tip, moving through a two-dimensional material. However, in real three-dimensional materials, tensile cracks form a planar surface whose edge is a rapidly moving one-dimensional singular front. The dynamics of these fronts under repetitive interaction with material inhomogeneities (asperities) and the morphology of the fracture surface that they create are not yet understood. Here we show that perturbations to a crack front in a brittle material result in long-lived and highly localized waves, which we call 'front waves' These waves exhibit a unique characteristic shape and propagate along the crack front at approximately the Rayleigh wave speed (the speed of sound along a free surface). Following interaction, counter-propagating front waves retain both their shape and amplitude. They create characteristic traces along the fracture surface, providing cracks with both inertia and a new mode of dissipation. Front waves are intrinsically three-dimensional, and cannot exist in conventional two-dimensional theories of fracture. Because front waves can transport and distribute asperity-induced energy fluctuations throughout the crack front, they may help to explain how cracks remain a single coherent entity, despite repeated interactions with randomly dispersed asperities.},

   abstract = {Following earlier observations of multiple micro-crack formation accompanying crack propagation under dynamic conditions, the question regarding the discrepancy between the 'theoretically anticipated' maximal crack (Rayleigh wave) speed and those observed typically in amorphous, isotropic solids is examined experimentally. It is shown that if the production of these multiple micro-cracks ahead of the main fracture is suppressed by fabricating a material possessing a thin uniform region of vanishing intrinsic (molecular/atomic) material strength, the crack speed is materially increased to the point of approaching the Rayleigh wave speed. Moreover, it is also shown that the presence of small discreet flaws of sufficient spatial density similarly 'weakens' the material to produce fracture speeds comparable to the Rayleigh wave speed. One deduces, therefore, that for a single crack front the linearized theory of elastodynamics correctly predicts the dynamic crack propagation behavior of a solid with sufficiently low material strength.},

   abstract = {In this paper, the general constitutive equation for a transversely isotropic hyperelastic solid in the presence of initial stress is derived, based on the theory of invariants. In the general finite deformation case for a compressible material this requires 18 invariants (17 for an incompressible material). The equations governing infinitesimal motions superimposed on a finite deformation are then used in conjunction with the constitutive law to examine the propagation of both homogeneous plane waves and, with the restriction to two dimensions, Rayleigh surface waves. For this purpose we consider incompressible materials and a restricted set of invariants that is sufficient to capture both the effects of initial stress and transverse isotropy. Moreover, the equations are specialized to the undeformed configuration in order to compare with the classical formulation of Biot. One feature of the general theory is that the speeds of homogeneous plane waves and surface waves depend nonlinearly on the initial stress, in contrast to the situation of the more specialized isotropic and orthotropic theories of Biot. The speeds of (homogeneous plane) shear waves and Rayleigh waves in an incompressible material are obtained and the significant differences from Biot’s results for both isotropic and transversely isotropic materials are highlighted with calculations based on a specific form of strain-energy function.},

   abstract = {This paper demonstrates that rapid fracture of ideal brittle lattices naturally involves phenomena long seen in experiment, but which have been hard to understand from a continuum point of view. These idealized models do not mimic realistic microstructure, but can be solved exactly and understood completely. First it is shown that constant velocity crack solutions do not exist at all for a range of velocities starting at zero and ranging up to about one quarter of the shear wave speed. Next it is shown that above this speed cracks are by and large linearly stable, but that at sufficiently high velocity they become unstable with respect to a nonlinear microcracking instability. The way this instability works itself out is related to the scenario known as intermittency, and the basic time scale which governs it is the inverse of the amount of dissipation in the model. Finally, we compare the theoretical framework with some new experiments in Plexiglas, and show that all qualitative features of the theory are mirrored in our experimental results.},

   abstract = {The dynamics of planar crack fronts in hetergeneous media near the critical load for onset of crack motion are investigated both analytically and by numerical simulations. Elasticity of the solid leads to long-range stress transfer along the crack front which is nonmonotonic in time due to the elastic waves in the medium. In the quasistatic limit with instantaneous stress transfer, the crack front exhibits dynamic critical phenomenon, with a second-order-like transition from a pinned to a moving phase as the applied load is increased through a critical value. At criticality, the crack front is self-affine, with a roughness exponent zeta=0.34+/-0.02. The dynamic exponent z is found to be equal to 0.74+/-0.03 and the correlation length exponent nu=1.52+/-0.02. These results are in good agreement with those obtained from an epsilon expansion. Sound-travel time delays in the stress transfer do not change the static exponents but the dynamic exponent z becomes exactly one. Real elastic waves, however, lead to overshoots in the stresses above their eventual static value when one part of the crack front moves forward. Simplified models of these stress overshoots are used to show that overshoots are relevant at the depinning transition leading to a decrease in the critical load and an apparent jump in the velocity of the crack front directly to a nonzero value. In finite systems, the velocity also shows hysteretic behavior as a function of the loading. These results suggest a first-order-like transition. Possible implications for real tensile cracks are discussed.},

   abstract = {We consider a variational formulation of quasi-static brittle fracture and develop a new finite-element-based computational framework for propagation of cracks in three-dimensional bodies. We outline a consistent thermodynamical framework for crack propagation in elastic solids and show that both the elastic equilibrium response as well as the local crack evolution follow in a natural format by exploitation of a global Clausius-Planck inequality in the sense of Coleman's method. Consequently, the crack propagation direction associated with the classical Griffith criterion is identified by the material configurational force which maximizes the local dissipation at the crack front. The variational formulation is realized numerically by a standard spatial discretization with finite elements which yields a discrete formulation of the global dissipation in terms configurational nodal forces. Therefore, the constitutive setting of crack propagation in the space-discretized finite element context is naturally related to discrete nodes of a typical finite element mesh. In a consistent way with the node-based setting, the discretization of the evolving crack discontinuity is performed by the doubling of critical nodes and interface facets of the mesh. The crucial step for the success of this procedure is its embedding into an r-adaptive crack-facet reorientation procedure based on configurational-force-based indicators in conjunction with crack front constraints. We propose a staggered solution procedure that results in a sequence of positive definite discrete subproblems with successively decreasing overall stiffness, providing a robust algorithmic setting in the postcritical range. The predictive capabilitiy of the proposed formulation is demonstrated by means of representative numerical simulations. © 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {This paper proposes a computational framework for dynamic crack propagation in rubber in which a nonlinear finite element analysis using cohesive zone modeling approach is used. A suddenly initiated crack at the center of biaxially stretched sheet problem is studied under plane stress conditions. A transient dynamic analysis using implicit time integration scheme is performed. In the constitutive modeling, the continuum is characterized by finite-viscoelasticity theory and coupled with the fracture processes using a cohesive zone model. This computational framework was introduced previously by the present authors (Elmukashfi and Kroon, 2012). In the current work, the use of a rate-dependent cohesive model is examined in addition to investigation of generalized biaxial loading cases. A Kelvin–Voigt element is used to describe the rate-dependent cohesive model wherein the spring is described by a bilinear law and dashpot with a constant viscosity is adopted. An explicit integration is used to incorporate the rate-dependent cohesive model in the finite element environment. A parametric study over the cohesive viscosity is performed and the steady crack propagation velocity is evaluated and compared with experimental data. It appears that the viscosity varies with the crack speed. Further, the total work of fracture is estimated using rate-independent cohesive law such that the strength of the cohesive zone is assumed to be constant and the separation work per unit area is determined form the experimental data. The results show that fracture-related processes, i.e. creation of new surfaces, cavitation and crystallization; contribute to the total work of fracture in a contradictory manner.},

   abstract = {At high crack velocities in metallic materials nearly all plastic strain accumulates at very high strain-rates, typically in the range 103 s−1 to 105 s−1. At these rates, dislocation motion is limited by dynamic lattice effects and the plastic strain-rate increases approximately linearly with stress. The problem for a crack growing at high velocity is posed for steady-state, small scale yielding in elastic/rate-dependent plastic solids. A general expression is derived for the near-tip stress intensity factor in terms of the remote intensity factor, or equivalently for the near-tip energy release-rate in terms of the overall release-rate. An approximate calculation of the plastic strain-rates provides this relation in analytical form. Imposition of the condition that the near-tip energy release-rate be maintained at a critical value provides a propagation equation for the growing crack. A single, nondimensional combination of material constants emerges as the controlling parameter. Implications for dynamic crack propagation are discussed.},

   abstract = {In a previous paper (Leblond et al., 2011), we proposed a theoretical interpretation of the experimentally well known instability of coplanar crack propagation in mode I+III. The interpretation relied on a stability analysis based on analytical expressions of the stress intensity factors for a crack slightly perturbed both within and out of its original plane, due to Gao and Rice (1986) and Movchan et al. (1998), coupled with a double propagation criterion combining Griffith's energetic condition and principle of local symmetry. Under such assumptions instability modes were indeed evidenced for values of the mode mixity ratio of the mode III to mode I stress intensity factors applied remotely larger than some threshold depending only on Poisson's ratio. Unfortunately, the predicted thresholds were much larger than those generally observed for typical values of this material parameter. While the subcritical character of the nonlinear bifurcation from coplanar to fragmented fronts has been proposed as a possible explanation for this discrepancy (Chen et al., 2015), we propose here an alternative explanation based on the introduction of a constitutive relationship between the fracture energy and the mode mixity ratio, which is motivated by experimental observations. By reexamining the linear stability analysis of a planar propagating front, we show that such a relationship suffices, provided that it is strong enough, to lower significantly the threshold value of the mode mixity ratio for instability so as to bring it in a range more consistent with experiments. Interesting formulae are also derived for the distributions of the perturbed stress intensity factors and energy release rate, in the special case of perturbations of the crack surface and front obeying the principle of local symmetry and having reached a stationary state.},

   abstract = {We analyse the propagation of elastic waves in soft materials subjected to finite deformations. We derive explicit phase velocity relations for matter with pronounced stiffening effect, namely Gent model, and apply these results to study elastic wave propagation in (a) nearly incompressible materials such as biological tissues and polymers, (b) highly compressible and (c) negative Poisson's ratio or auxetic materials. We find, that for nearly incompressible materials transverse wave velocities exhibit strong dependence on the direction of propagation and initial strain state, whereas the longitudinal wave velocity is not affected significantly until extreme levels of deformation are attained. For highly compressible materials, we show that both longitudinal and transversal wave velocities depend strongly on deformation and direction of propagation. Moreover, the dependence becomes stronger when stiffening effects increase. When compression is applied, the longitudinal wave velocity decreases regardless the direction of wave propagation in highly compressible materials, and increases for most of the directions in materials with negative Poisson's ratio behaviour. We demonstrate that finite deformations can influence elastic wave propagation through combinations of induced effective compressibility and stiffness.},

The role of the triaxiality of the stress siate in determining whether decohesion or localization occurs first is investigated. A parametric study is also carried out for a crystal matrix using two desaiptions of the interface shear behaviour: one is periodic in the s h e a displacement across the interface. while the other allows for shear decohesion 1. Introduction Void nucleation by inclusion debonding plays a key role in determining the ductility and toughness of a wide variety of structural metals and metal-based composites. Once the voids nucleate, they grow by plastic deformation of the surrounding matrix material until they eventually coalesce. A continuum-interface model aimed at providing a unified W e w o r k for describing the evolution from initial debonding through decohesion and subsequent void growth was developed in Needleman (1987). In this formulation, constitutive relations are specified independently for the matrix, the particle and the interface. The interface constitutive relation is such that, with increasing interfacial separation, the traction across the interface reaches a maximum, decreases and eventually vanishes. A characteristic length scale is introduced because the interface description involves both a strength and a work of separation. In previous void-nucleation studies within this framework, e.g. Needleman (1987). Nutt and Needleman (1987). Povirk et ul(1991). the plastic response of the ductile phase has been described by a phenomenological theory of plasticity with isotropic hardening. However, the void-nucleating particles in the materials of interest in these studies are typically on the order of 0.1-1.0 pm. At this size scale, the crystallographic nature of metal plasticity can come into play. The discreteness of crystallographic slip systems leads to a directional dependence of plastic flow that is not accounted for by the isotropic-hardening model. Furthermore, because there are high strains at the particle-matrix interface, textural-softening-induced shear-band localizations can occur.},

   abstract = {Experiments of crack propagation in rubbers have shown that a discontinuous jump of crack propagation velocity can occur as energy release rate increases, which is known as the "mode transition" phenomenon. Although it is believed that the mode transition is strongly related to the mechanical properties, the nature of the mode transition had not been revealed. In this study, dynamic crack propagation on an elastomer was investigated using the finite element method (FEM) with a hyperviscoelastic material model. A series of pure shear test was carried out numerically with FEM simulations and crack velocities were measured under various values of tensile strain. As a result, our FEM simulations successfully reproduced the mode transition. The success of realising the mode transition phenomenon by a simple FEM model, which was achieved for the first time ever, helped to explain that the phenomenon occurs owing to a characteristic non-monotonic temporal development of principal stress near the crack tip. Rubbers, or elastomers, have exotic mechanical properties, such as entropic elasticity, viscosity and incompress-ibility. Due to such properties rubbers find various industrial applications, e.g., tyres, dampers, etc. From the viewpoint of industry, it is important to understand the fracture mechanism of rubbers for better design of reliable rubber products. The relationship between the velocity of the crack propagation and the energy release rate has been vigorously investigated as a fundamental property to evaluate how easily rubber products are damaged under external loading. A large number of studies have been carried out to investigate the dynamic crack propagation in rubber materials, including experiments 1-6 , theoretical studies 7-11 and numerical analyses 12-18. Some experiments for the crack propagation in rubbers reported an interesting phenomenon: The crack velocity shows a discontinuous jump as energy release rate increases, which is called a "mode transition" 5,6. There are two mode regions, namely the "slow mode" with low crack velocity at low energy release rates and the "fast mode" with high crack velocity at high energy release rates. The two propagation modes show distinct features such as roughness on the crack surface, which implies highly complicated physics behind the mode transition. The mode transition phenomenon is industrially important because it is empirically known that the property of the mode transition is related to lifetime of rubber products; i.e., the higher the transition energy (energy release rate at the mode transition) becomes, the higher durability the rubber has. There is another kind of transition of the crack propagation in rubber materials that occurs at the vicinity of the sound speed (subsonic-supersonic transition) and has been investigated intensively 16,19,20-22. The mechanism of the subsonic-supersonic transition is theoretically well explained 16,20 and this phenomenon has been reproduced successfully by numerical simulations 16,22. On the other hand, the mechanism of the slow-fast mode transition, which is found around the crack velocity much lower than the sound speed in the material, has not been revealed because of the lack of a simple model to reproduce the phenomenon. While Carbone and Persson 11 have theoretically explained the discontinuity of the mode transition through the effect of the locally high temperature ("hot crack"), their explanation stands only when the crack grows very fast and, in reality, the mode transition can be observed at a low crack velocity. In addition, the hot crack model presupposes a quite high temperature on the crack tip. Thus, there is still room for discussion about the mechanism of the slow-fast mode transition on the dynamic crack propagation in rubbers.},

   abstract = {Within the linear viscoelastic theory, crack tip fields are calculated at various crack tip velocities. A transition from rubbery to glassy material behavior in the vicinity of the crack tip can be observed. Shear and bulk behavior is analyzed separately. Whereas the increase of tearing energy at higher crack tip velocities can be ascribed to the shear behavior, bulk behavior influences the fracture mechanism. The results support experimental investigations that the instability separating stable from unstable crack propagation is related to a change in the fracture mechanism. At low crack tip velocities, material separation is the result of formation, growth, and coalescence of cavities. At high crack tip velocities, cavitation is suppressed and fracture is driven by a rather brittle mechanism resulting in a decreased amount of energy to propagate the fracture process zone. © 2008 Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.},

We model them using harmonic and anharmonic forces between particles in a lattice, both in tension (Mode I) and antiplane shear (Mode III). One of our main objects has been to determine when supersonic cracks traveling faster than the shear wave speed can occur. In contrast to subsonic cracks, the speed of supersonic cracks is best expressed as a function of strain, not stress intensity factor. Nevertheless, we find that supersonic cracks are more common than has previously been realized. They occur both in Mode I and Mode III, with or without anharmonic changes of interparticle forces prior to breaking, and with or without dissipation. The extent and shape of the supersonic branch of solutions depends strongly on details such as lattice geometry, force law anharmonicity, and amount of dissipation. Particle forces that stiffen prior to breaking lead to larger supersonic branches. Increasing dissipation also tends to promote the existence of supersonic states. We include a number of other results, including analytical expressions for crack speeds in the high-strain limit, and numerical results for the spatial extent of regions where particles interact anharmonically. Finally, we note a curious phenomenon, where for forces that weaken with increasing strain, cracks can slow down when one pulls on them harder.},

@article{Jia2012,
   abstract = {Continuum mechanics predicts that the propagation speed of non-equilibrium information in solids is limited by the longitudinal wave speed, so is crack propagation. However, solids are essentially discrete systems. In this paper, via theoretical analysis and numerical simulations, it is demonstrated in a straightforward way that non-equilibrium disturbance (e.g. force, displacement, energy, and so on) can propagate at a supersonic speed in discrete systems, although the magnitude of the disturbance attenuates very quickly. In dynamic fracture, a cascade of atomic-bond breaking events provides an amplification mechanism to counterbalance the attenuation of the disturbance. Therefore, supersonic crack propagation can be realized in a domino way. Another key factor for supersonic crack propagation is to ensure sufficient energy flowing into the crack tip. Since most energy can only be transferred at a speed limited by the longitudinal wave speed, the conditions for the occurrence of supersonic crack propagation are not easily met in most situations, unless there is high pre-stored energy along the crack path or continuous energy supply from the loading concomitantly moving with the crack tip. A quantitative relation between supersonic crack propagation speed and material properties and parameters is given, which implies that knowing all the classical macroscopic quantities is not enough in determining the supersonic crack propagation speed, and the microstructure does play a role. Moreover, it is interesting to note that fracture toughness affects the crack propagation speed in the subsonic regime, but not in the supersonic regime, because the deformation/stress is uniform in front of a supersonic crack where strength criterion dominates.},

   abstract = {A macroscopic theory is proposed to describe, explain, and predict the nucleation and propagation of fracture and healing in elastomers undergoing arbitrarily large quasistatic deformations. The theory, which can be viewed as a natural generalization of the phase-field approximation of the variational theory of brittle fracture of Francfort and Marigo (1998) to account for physical attributes innate to elastomers that have been recently unveiled by experiments at high spatio-temporal resolution, rests on two central ideas. The first one is to view elastomers as solids capable to undergo finite elastic deformations and capable also to phase transition to another solid of vanishingly small stiffness: the forward phase transition serves to model the nucleation and propagation of fracture while the reverse phase transition models the possible healing. The second central idea is to take the phase transition to be driven by the competition between a combination of strain energy and hydrostatic stress concentration in the bulk and surface energy on the created/healed new surfaces in the elastomer. From an applications point of view, the proposed theory amounts to solving a system of two coupled and nonlinear PDEs for the deformation field and an order parameter, or phase field. A numerical scheme is presented to generate solutions for these PDEs in N=2 and 3 space dimensions. This is based on an efficient non-conforming finite-element discretization, which remains stable for large deformations and elastomers of any compressibility, together with an implicit gradient flow solver, which is able to deal with the large changes in the deformation field that can ensue locally in space and time from the nucleation of fracture. The last part of this paper is devoted to presenting sample simulations of the so-called Gent–Park experiment. Those are confronted with recent experimental results for various types of silicone elastomers.},

   abstract = {© 2015 Taylor  &  Francis Group, London, UK. Crack growth dynamics is studied experimentally and analyzed focusing on both kinetics and crack tip profiles utilizing acrylonitrile butadiene rubbers which are filled with different amounts of carbon black. The behavior of crack growth is characterized by the relation between the tearing energy and the crack growth rate, and all samples show the discontinuous transition of the crack growth rate between the ‘slow mode’ and ‘fast mode’ in a narrow range of the tearing energy. In the ‘fast mode’ crack growth rate (about 1–100 m/sec) shows a power-law relationship with the tearing energy, while in the ‘slow mode’ the crack growth rate (about 0.01–1 mm/sec) exhibits no definite dependence on the tearing energy. The high resolution measurements reveals that the features of the crack tip profile drastically change at the discontinuous transition of the crack growth rate. The crack tip profiles observed are characterized by the gap from the parabolic profile expected by Linear Elastic Fracture Mechanics (LEFM). The weakly nonlinear elasticity theory on fracture dynamics, which considers the contribution of the second-order modulus to the strain field, successfully explains the small gaps ( <  ca. 1 mm) independently of whether the mode of interestis ‘slow’ or ‘fast’. The failure of the theory becomes pronounced in the cases of the large gaps ( >  ca. 1 mm) in the ‘fast mode’ where the specimens undergo large strain and high strain rate. These results demonstrate the significance of the nonlinear viscoelasticity in the crack growth phenomena.},

   abstract = {We present simulations of 3 D dynamic fracture which suggest that a persistent elastic wave is generated in response to a localized perturbation of a propagating crack front, e.g., by a local heterogeneity of critical fracture energy. The wave propagates along the moving crack front and spreads, relative to its origin point on the fractured surface, at a speed slightly below the Rayleigh speed. The simulations were done using the spectral elastodynamic methodology of Geubelle and Rice (1995). They model failure by a displacement -weakening cohesive model, which corresponds in the singular crack limit to crack growth at a critical fracture energy. Confirmation that crack front waves with properties like in our simulation do exist has been provided by Ramanathan and Fisher (1997). Through a derivation based on the linearized perturbation analysis of dynamic singular tensile crack growth by Willis and Movchan (1995), those authors found by numerical evaluation that a transfer function thereby introduced has a simple pole at a certain ω/k ratio, corresponding to a non-dispersive wave. Further, we show that as a consequence of these persistent waves, when a crack grows through a region of small random fluctuations in fracture energy, the variances of both the local propagation velocity and the deformed slope of the crack front increase, according to linearized perturbation theory, in direct proportion to distance of growth into the randomly heterogeneous region. That rate of disordering is more rapid than the growth of the variances with the logarithm of distance established by Perrin and Rice (1994) for a model elastodynamic fracture theory based on a scalar wave equation. That scalar case, which shows slowly decaying (as t-1/2) rather than persistent crack front waves, is analyzed here too. © 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {Linear Elastic Fracture Mechanics (LEFM) provides a consistent framework to evaluate quantitatively the energy flux released to the tip of a growing crack. Still, the way in which the crack selects its velocity in response to this energy flux remains far from completely understood. To uncover the underlying mechanisms, we experimentally studied damage and dissipation processes that develop during the dynamic failure of polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA), classically considered as the archetype of brittle amorphous materials. We evidenced a well-defined critical velocity along which failure switches from nominally-brittle to quasi-brittle, where crack propagation goes hand in hand with the nucleation and growth of microcracks. Via post-mortem analysis of the fracture surfaces, we were able to reconstruct the complete spatiotemporal microcracking dynamics with micrometer/nanosecond resolution. We demonstrated that the true local propagation speed of individual crack fronts is limited to a fairly low value, which can be much smaller than the apparent speed measured at the continuum-level scale. By coalescing with the main front, microcracks boost the macroscale velocity through an acceleration factor of geometrical origin. We discuss the key role of damage-related internal variables in the selection of macroscale fracture dynamics.},

In a finite element framework, the method provides a tool to visualize the viscous dissipation zone. Simulations of crack growth using inter-element cohesive surfaces was performed for strips of various sizes. The same driving force was applied to each strip. Results show that the finite width of the strip constrains the development of the viscous dissipation zone. There is a critical size of the strip relative to the viscoelastic length scale, calculated by the crack speed and characteristic relaxation time, below which the crack speed exhibits a dependence on geometry.},

Expressions for the global material and dissipation forces are obtained from a global balance of energy–momentum that incorporates dissipation from inelastic material behavior. It is shown that in the special case of steady-state growth, the global dissipation force equals the work rate of dissipation, and the global material force and J-integral methods are equivalent. For implementation in finite element computations, an equivalent domain expression of the global material force is developed from the weak form of the energy–momentum balance. The method is applied to model problems of cohesive fracture in a remote K-field for viscoelasticity and elastoplasticity. The viscoelastic problem is used to compare various element discretizations in combination with different schemes for computing strain gradients. For the elastoplastic problem, the effects of cohesive and bulk properties on the plastic dissipation are examined using calculations of the global dissipation force.},

   abstract = {© 2015 Taylor  &  Francis Group, London, UK. Crack growth dynamics is studied experimentally and analyzed focusing on both kinetics and crack tip profiles utilizing acrylonitrile butadiene rubbers which are filled with different amounts of carbon black. The behavior of crack growth is characterized by the relation between the tearing energy and the crack growth rate, and all samples show the discontinuous transition of the crack growth rate between the ‘slow mode’ and ‘fast mode’ in a narrow range of the tearing energy. In the ‘fast mode’ crack growth rate (about 1–100 m/sec) shows a power-law relationship with the tearing energy, while in the ‘slow mode’ the crack growth rate (about 0.01–1 mm/sec) exhibits no definite dependence on the tearing energy. The high resolution measurements reveals that the features of the crack tip profile drastically change at the discontinuous transition of the crack growth rate. The crack tip profiles observed are characterized by the gap from the parabolic profile expected by Linear Elastic Fracture Mechanics (LEFM). The weakly nonlinear elasticity theory on fracture dynamics, which considers the contribution of the second-order modulus to the strain field, successfully explains the small gaps ( <  ca. 1 mm) independently of whether the mode of interestis ‘slow’ or ‘fast’. The failure of the theory becomes pronounced in the cases of the large gaps ( >  ca. 1 mm) in the ‘fast mode’ where the specimens undergo large strain and high strain rate. These results demonstrate the significance of the nonlinear viscoelasticity in the crack growth phenomena.},

Whereas it is known that intrinsic fracture energies of soft materials are relatively low, how the intrinsic fracture energy cooperates with mechanical dissipation in process zone to give high fracture toughness of soft materials is not well understood. In addition, it is still challenging to predict fracture energies and crack-tip strain fields of soft tough materials. Here, we report a scaling theory that accounts for synergistic effects of intrinsic fracture energies and dissipation on the toughening of soft materials. We then develop a coupled cohesive-zone and Mullins-effect model capable of quantitatively predicting fracture energies of soft tough materials and strain fields around crack tips in soft materials under large deformation.

   abstract = {Crack propagation in rubber-like materials is of great practical importance but still not well understood. We study the contribution to the crack propagation energy (per unit area) G from the viscoelastic deformations of the rubber in front of the propagating crack tip. We show that G takes the standard form G(v, T) = G 0 [1 + f (v, T)] where G 0 is associated with the (complex) bond-breaking processes at the crack tip while f (v, T) is determined by the viscoelastic energy dissipation in front of the crack tip. As applications, we discuss the role of crack propagation for adhesion, rolling resistance and sliding friction for smooth surfaces, and for rubber wear.

Furthermore, the study researches the separation of the total dissipation in terms of the change in elastic energy and in terms of the material dissipation by a configurational change obtained from the global energy momentum balance. On the numerical side, an equivalent general expression of the vectorial material forces is derived from the weak form of the energy momentum balance.

The computations are applied to a stationary crack in a circular pre-cracked domain and a compact tension specimen under plasticity condition. The results show that the material force approach remains path independent only if all components of the momentum balance equation are properly included into the corresponding variational formulation. In addition, the cohesive fracture theory is combined with the material force approach in order to increase the clarity of the interpretation of the approach in engineering applications. Correspondingly, the results obtained from the compact tension specimen with three different free energy functions are compared to the conventional J-integral method and to experimental results available from a previous study. The contributions of this study are threefold. First, the path dependency of the material force approach in elasto-plastic continua is found to be considerably depending on the so-called material body forces. Secondly, interpretation of the induced material dissipation forces in the definition of the crack driving forces is not explicitly clear but they play an important role in case of path independency.

   abstract = {The concept of material or configurational forces, albeit not new, is one of those innovations in theoretical mechanics that has struggled to reach the success of wide-spread acceptance, or even familiarity. Perhaps, one reason for this is to be found in the few available introductory examples or in the non-trivial physical-mathematical approach often taken to establish this concept, although by no means more complex than other treatments in non-linear continuum mechanics. With this work we aim at contributing to the dissemination of configurational mechanics concepts by guiding the reader through an introductory analytical example step by step and comparing it to numerically obtained results. The numerical model is solved with OpenGeoSys (OGS-6), an open-source, C++-based, object-oriented finite element platform for the thermo-hydro-mechanical analysis of coupled processes in fractured porous media. In the spirit of the open-source philosophy, and to enable the readers to reproduce the example themselves, both the source code and the input files are available online. The example highlights—in a simple and intuitive manner—several insightful aspects related to configurational mechanics.},

   abstract = {A material force method is proposed for evaluating the energy release rate and work rate of dissipation for fracture in inelastic materials. The inelastic material response is characterized by an internal variable model with an explicitly defined free energy density and dissipation potential. Expressions for the global material and dissipation forces are obtained from a global balance of energy–momentum that incorporates dissipation from inelastic material behavior. It is shown that in the special case of steady-state growth, the global dissipation force equals the work rate of dissipation, and the global material force and J-integral methods are equivalent. For implementation in finite element computations, an equivalent domain expression of the global material force is developed from the weak form of the energy–momentum balance. The method is applied to model problems of cohesive fracture in a remote K-field for viscoelasticity and elastoplasticity. The viscoelastic problem is used to compare various element discretizations in combination with different schemes for computing strain gradients. For the elastoplastic problem, the effects of cohesive and bulk properties on the plastic dissipation are examined using calculations of the global dissipation force.},

   abstract = {The theoretical understanding of the fracture mechanics of rubber is not as well developed as for other engineering materials, such as metals. The present study is intended to further the understanding of the dissipative processes that take place in rubber in the vicinity of a propagating crack tip. This dissipation contributes significantly to the total fracture toughness of the rubber and is therefore of great interest from a fracture mechanics point of view. To study this, a computational framework for analysing high-speed crack growth in a biaxially stretched rubber under plane stress is therefore formulated. The main purpose is to investigate the energy release rates required for crack propagation under different modes of biaxial stretching. The results show, that inertia comes into play when the crack speed exceeds about 50 m/s. The total work of fracture by far exceeds the surface energy consumed at the very crack tip, and the difference must be attributed to dissipative damage processes in the vicinity of the crack tip. The size of this damage/dissipation zone is expected to be a few millimetres.},

Starting from the local stress and deformation fields at the tip of the crack, a non-linear, first order differential equation is found to describe the time history of the crack size if the stress applied far from the crack is constant. The differential equation contains the creep compliance and the intrinsic surface energy of the material. The surface energy concept for viscoelastic materials is clarified. Inertial effects are not considered, but the influence of temperature is included for thermorheologically simple materials. Initial crack velocities are given as a function of applied load in closed form, as well as a comparison of calculated crack growth history with experiments. Above a certain high stress, crack propagation ensues at high speeds controlled by material inertia while at a lower limit infinite time is required to produce crack growth. Thus an upper and lower limit criterion of the Griffith type exists. For rate insensitive (elastic) materials the two limits coalesce and only the brittle fracture criterion of Griffith exists. The implications of these results for creep fracture in metals and inorganic glasses are examined.},

Our procedure is similar to that of Griltith in its use of a global energy balance. The Grittith method is generalized by the inclusion of the rate-of-energy dissipation term in the balance law. This rate-of-dissipation term is derived to represent the behavior of viscoelastic materials; thus the final results are applicable primarily to polymeric behavior. Our final results are concise analytical expressions [Eqns. (50)] for crack velocity as a function of the creep properties of the material, the level of loading, and the energy or work content of the crack-generated new surface. These analytical solutions are quite general; the primary restriction occurs because they are derived under asymptotic conditions of high- and low-crack velocities. Finally, we compare the analytical predictions with experimental results for a polyurethane elastomer.},

@article{Knauss2015,
   abstract = {This review is written in honor of Max L. Williams who not only started this International Journal of Fracture (the author’s Ph.D. advisor. Originally the Journal was called International Journal of Fracture Mechanics) but who had a seminally fundamental influence on the course of fracture mechanics in general, and specifically as applied to the time dependent failure of elastomers/polymers. In view of that background this article reviews developments over more than 50 years, as colored by my own experiences in regard to this topic. It seems appropriate to include a historical perspective that starts during pre-journal times and addresses the need for understanding time dependent processes governing fracture in rate sensitive materials. To the largest extent, the rate dependence is important where polymers are involved, though under more limited conditions metals and igneous solids as well as ligneous ones exhibit time dependent fracture characteristics. Such facts notwithstanding, the major discussion in this contribution is devoted here to the time dependent fracture of polymeric materials, and elastomeric ones in particular. The emphasis will be thus on time dependent issues governed primarily by the fracture processes in elastomeric solids, which have evolved largely in parallel to problems devoted to the more rigid polymers. Because consideration of fracture of the rigid polymers has often, if not usually, minimized the time dependence, only cursory attention is paid to these, in spite of the fact that they constitute a very important class of materials in the modern engineering community. From an engineering perspective this review is motivated also by an exposition of a persistent lack of knowledge concerning time dependent fracture issues. Most of the work attached to the notion of viscoelastic fracture is—intentionally or by omission—associated with the phenomenon of crack growth under steady state conditions with the expectation that this understanding leads implicitly to resolution of problems governed by transient loadings. Besides reviewing the historical evolution of the knowledge in this field over the past half century, it is a main purpose of this paper to offer information that has either been ignored or has not been explored (this includes the work of the author), but which contradicts this “popular” perception. It is thus an intentionally large part of this presentation which documents compelling motivation for addressing fracture aspects, that are generally important from an engineering design and analysis point-of-view: specifically, it is intended to illustrate the remarkable degree by which the steady state solution to crack propagation deviates from experimental information when transient conditions prevail, and the large range of time scales over which this failure behavior is observed.},

   abstract = {A unified derivation of crack tip flux integrals and their associated domain representations is laid out in this paper. Using a general balance statement as the starting point, crack tip integrals and complementary integrals which are valid for general material response and arbitrary crack tip motion are obtained. Our derivation emphasizes the viewpoint that crack tip integrals are direct consequences of momentum balance. Invoking appropriate restrictions on material response and crack tip motion leads directly to integrals which are in use in crack analysis. Additional crack tip integrals which are direct consequences of total energy and momentum balance are obtained in a similar manner. Some results on dual (or complementary) integrals are discussed. The study provides a framework for the derivation of crack tip integrals and allows them to be viewed from a common perspective. In fact, it will be easy to recognize that every crack tip integral under discussion can be obtained immediately from the general result by appropriately identifying the terms in the general flux tensor. The evaluation of crack tip contour integrals in numerical studies is a potential source of inaccuracy. With the help of weighting functions these integrals are recast into finite domain integrals. The latter integrals are naturally compatible with the finite element method and can be shown to be ideally suited for numerical studies of cracked bodies and the accurate calculation of pointwise energy release rates along a curvilinear three-dimensional crack front. The value of the domain integral does not depend on domain size and shape - this property provides an independent check on the consistency and quality of the numerical calculation. The success of the J-based fracture mechanics approach has led to much literature on pathindependent integrals. It will be shown that various so-called path-independent integrals (including path and area integrals) are but alternate forms of the general result referred to above and do not provide any additional information which is not already contained in the general result. Recent attempts to apply these 'newer' integrals to crack growth problems are discussed. © 1987.},

@article{Menzel2007,
   abstract = {The main goal of this work consists in the elaboration of the material or rather configurational mechanics in the context of multiplicative elastoplasticity. This nowadays well-established approach, which is inherently related to the concept of a material isomorphism or in other words to a local rearrangement, is adopted as a paradigm for the general modelling of finite inelasticity. The overall motion in space is throughout assumed to be compatible and sufficiently smooth. According to the underlying configurations, namely the material and the spatial configuration as well as what we call the intermediate configuration, different representations of balance of linear momentum are set up for the static case. The underlying flux terms are thereby identified as stress tensors of Piola and Cauchy type and are assumed to derive from a free energy density function, thus taking hyperelastic formats. Moreover, the incorporated source terms, namely the configurational volume forces, are identified by comparison arguments. These quantities include gradients of distortions as well as dislocation density tensors. In particular those dislocation density tensors related to the elastic or plastic distortion do not vanish due to the general incompatibility of the intermediate configuration. As a result, configurational volume forces which are settled in the intermediate configuration embody non-vanishing dislocation density tensors while their material counterparts directly incorporate non-vanishing gradients of distortions. This fundamental property enables us to recover the celebrated Peach-Koehler force for finite inelasticity, acting on a single dislocation, from the intermediate configuration volume forces. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

   abstract = {The concept of material configurational forces is applied to predict the mixed mode crack propagation. A new fracture criterion based on the resultant of configurational forces (termed as C-force criterion) is proposed. The basic assumption is that the onset of crack growth occurs when the resultant of configurational forces reaches a critical value and the crack growth takes place in the direction of resultant configurational forces. An implementation of the configurational forces into the finite element is presented. The newly proposed C-force criterion is further validated through a series of examples. It is concluded that the predictions of mixed-mode crack propagation by C-force criterion are in good agreement with experimental data in the open literatures. In addition, an experimental procedure on evaluation the configurational forces is proposed by using the digital image correlation. It is demonstrated that the C-force criterion provides a more convenient and accurate procedure to predict the mixed mode crack propagation.},

An advantage of our formulation is that it leads to an expression for the internal configurational force that, even when inertia is taken into account, includes no inertial contribution.

Selection of the class of media is guided by actual rheological behavior of monolithic and composite materials as well as the need for simplicity to be able to understand the effect of primary material and continuum parameters on crack growth behavior. First, pertinent aspects of J integral and energy release rate theory for nonlinear elastic media are discussed. Nonlinear viscoelastic constitutive equations are then given, and correspondence principles which establish a simple relationship between mechanical states of elastic and viscoelastic media are developed. These principles provide the basis for the subsequent extension of J integral theory to crack growth in viscoelastic materials. Emphasis is on predicting mechanical work available at the crack tip for initiation and continuation of growth; some examples show how viscoelastic properties and the J integral affect growth behavior. Included is the problem of a crack in a thin layer having different viscoelastic properties than the surrounding continuum. The Appendix gives an apparently new constitutive theory for elastic and viscoelastic materials with changing microstructure (e.g. distributed damage) and indicates the conditions under which the fracture theory in the body of the paper is applicable.},

Inhomogeneities are modeled by making the stored energy have an explicit dependence on the reference coordinates.

   abstract = {This paper discusses the crack driving force in elastic-plastic materials, with particular emphasis on incremental plasticity. Using the configurational forces approach we identify a "plasticity influence term" that describes crack tip shielding or anti-shielding due to plastic deformation in the body. Standard constitutive models for finite strain as well as small strain incremental plasticity are used to obtain explicit expressions for the plasticity influence term in a two-dimensional setting. The total dissipation in the body is related to the near-tip and far-field J-integrals and the plasticity influence term. In the special case of deformation plasticity the plasticity influence term vanishes identically whereas for rigid plasticity and elastic-ideal plasticity the crack driving force vanishes. For steady state crack growth in incremental elastic-plastic materials, the plasticity influence term is equal to the negative of the plastic work per unit crack extension and the total dissipation in the body due to crack propagation and plastic deformation is determined by the far-field J-integral. For non-steady state crack growth, the plasticity influence term can be evaluated by post-processing after a conventional finite element stress analysis. Theory and computations are applied to a stationary crack in a C(T)-specimen to examine the effects of contained, uncontained and general yielding. A novel method is proposed for evaluating J-integrals under incremental plasticity conditions through the configurational body force. The incremental plasticity near-tip and far-field J-integrals are compared to conventional deformational plasticity and experimental J-integrals. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {New domain integrals for extracting mixed-mode stress intensity factors along curved, three-dimensional bimaterial interface cracks are derived. In the derivation, the asymptotic auxiliary fields for the plane problem of a bimaterial interface crack are imposed along a curved crack front. The general crack-tip interaction integral (a contour integral surrounding a point on the crack front which is evaluated in the limit as the contour is shrunk onto the crack tip) is then expressed in domain form which is more suitable for numerical computation. A consequence of imposing the auxiliary fields along a curved crack front is that the auxiliary stress fields do not satisfy equilibrium, and the auxiliary strain fields do not satisfy compatibility. The terms which arise due to the lack of equilibrium and compatibility are not sufficiently singular to contribute to the crack-tip interaction integral or to affect its path independence; however, these terms become important when domain integral representations are introduced, because they involve fields which are not asymptotically close to the crack tip. In order to compute the pointwise stress intensity factors along the crack front, the domain integrals are evaluated as a post-processing step in the finite element method. In the numerical results, it is demonstrated that it is crucial to incorporate the terms that arise due to lack of equilibrium and compatibility of the auxiliary fields, especially in regions where the local crack front curvature is high. In the paper, we present two numerical examples. As a benchmark, we first consider the problem of a penny-shaped interface crack embedded in a cylinder. The results for the complex stress intensity factor and phase angle are found to be in excellent agreement with the analytical solution. The problem of an elliptical crack embedded between two dissimilar isotropic materials is also considered, and the results are discussed. © 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd.},

The use of TIP, after introduction of the appropriate axiom of local equilibrium state, or of a pseudopotential of dissipation is emphasized. The role of internal state variables in describing miscrostructures and the current misunderstanding with internal degrees of freedom are clarified.

   abstract = {Asymptotic analyses of the mechanical fields in front of stationary and propagating cracks are important for several reasons. For example, they facilitate the understanding of the mechanical and physical state in front of crack tips, and they enable prediction of crack growth. Furthermore, efficient modelling of arbitrary crack growth by use of XFEM (extended finite element method) requires accurate knowledge of the asymptotic crack tip fields. The present study focuses on the asymptotic fields in front of a crack that propagates dynamically in rubber. Static analyses of this type of problem have been made in previous studies. In order to be able to compare the present results with these earlier studies, the constitutive model from Knowles and Sternberg (J. Elast. 3:67-107, 1973) was adopted. It is assumed that viscoelastic stresses become negligible compared with the singular elastic stresses close to the crack tip. The present analysis shows that in materials with a significant hardening, the inertia term in the equations of motion becomes negligible in the asymptotic analysis. However, for a neoHookean type of model, inertia comes into play and causes a maximum theoretical crack speed that equals the shear wave speed. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

The loading applied at infinity is taken to be one of uniform uniaxial tension at right angles to the faces of the crack. For the particular class of elastic materials considered the tensile stress in large homogeneous uni-axial extension is asymptotic to a continuously adjustable power of the corresponding principal stretch. The asymptotic analysis of the foregoing crack problem is reduced to a nonlinear eigenvalue problem, the solution of which is established in closed form, in terms of elementary functions and a transcendental integral of such functions. This solution involves two arbitrary constants, one of which governs the amplitude of the ensuing elastostatic field near the tip of the crack. A precise estimate of the amplitude parameter, valid at sufficiently small load intensities, is deduced with the aid of a known conservation law. The remaining arbitrary constant, which is left indeterminate by the present lowest-order asymptotic analysis, does not affect the dominant behavior of the field quantities of primary physical interest. II-lustrative numerical results, appropriate to both hardening and softening materials, are presented.},

   abstract = {Over the recent years configurational mechanics has developed into a very active and successful topic both in continuum mechanics as well as in computational mechanics. On the continuum mechanics side the basic idea is to consider energy variations that go along with changes of the material configuration. Configurational forces are then energetically dual to these configurational changes. Configurational forces take the interpretation as being the driving forces in the kinetics of defects; like e.g., cracks, inclusions, phase boundaries, dislocations and the like. On the computational side it turns out that a discretisation scheme brings in artificial, discrete configurational forces that indicate in a certain sense the quality, e.g., of a finite-element mesh. This information can then be used to optimize the nodal material positions. Surprisingly, even driven by energetical arguments, it turns out that a finite element mesh optimized with respect to discrete configurational forces also renders superior results in terms of classical error measures.

   abstract = {Crack advance from short or long pre-cracks is predicted by the progressive failure of a cohesive zone in a strain gradient, elasto-plastic solid. The presence of strain gradients leads to the existence of an elastic zone at the tip of a stationary crack, for both the long crack and the short crack cases. This is in sharp contrast with previous asymptotic analyses of gradient solids, where elastic strains were neglected. The presence of an elastic singularity at the crack tip generates stresses which are sufficiently high to activate quasi-cleavage. For the long crack case, crack growth resistance curves are predicted for a wide range of ratios of cohesive zone strength to yield strength. Remarkably , this feature of an elastic singularity is preserved for short cracks, leading to a severe reduction in tensile ductility. In qualitative terms, these predictions resemble those of discrete dislocation calculations, including the concept of a dislocation-free zone at the crack tip.},

These cohesive zone models often suffer from a lack of generality and applying them typically requires calibrating a large number of model-specific parameters. To improve on these issues a new method has been proposed in this paper based on the Thick Level Set approach. In this concept, material degradation due to cyclic loading is the result of interaction between damage evolution and fracture mechanics. The Thick Level Set formulation has been extended to interface elements, in order to allow for separation of strain energy in the bulk and energy required for surface creation. Global fracture parameters, derived from a free energy description governing the interface elements, are used as input for the empirical crack growth rate relation (Paris’ equation). It must be emphasized that in contrast to existing fatigue models, the Thick Level Set approach does not require the definition of a damage evolution law. Instead, damage is updated automatically by a continuously moving damage front. It is shown that applicability is not limited to fatigue behavior of linear elastic materials; elastic-plastic materials such as steels can be analysed as well. The sensitivity of model parameters is investigated and discussed and the practical relevance is explored for standard test configurations.},

In addition to the time and rate dependent response of viscoelastic materials, fracture of these solids is governed by nonlinear processes at the fracture process zone and could also be accelerated by viscous energy dissipation. To this end, we propose a new phase field formulation in which fracture of viscoelastic solids is driven by both elastic and viscous components of the energy. The formulation requires a single additional parameter to quantify the portion of the viscous energy that contributes to fracture and is shown to be thermodynamically consistent. Viscoelastic material behavior, in the form of a Generalized Maxwell model, is obtained through a standard Prony-series type expansion. Fracture driven by viscous dissipation is studied on several important benchmark problems, including (i) a bar under creep, relaxation, strain rate and cyclic loadings, and (ii) two 3-point asphalt-beam bending problems that lead to crack propagation under mode I and mixed mode conditions. It is shown that at low strain rates viscous dissipation accelerates the fracture growth rate but essentially does not affect the crack path, while at high rates the effect of viscous dissipation is minor.},

   abstract = {We derive a thermodynamically-consistent, three-dimensional, rate form-based finite-deformation constitutive theory and computational approach for damage & fracture in nonlinear viscoelastic materials. The key ingredient that allows us to develop a physical criterion for fracture is the use of a Gibbs potential-based multinetwork formulation of viscoelasticity. An approach that is based on the use of the criticality of the averaged Gibbs potential over a fracture process zone is used for the initiation & propagation of cracks in a body. The rate form-based constitutive theory and fracture criterion are implemented into the Abaqus (2018) finite-element program through a user-material subroutine interface. Crack propagation is modeled as the failure of elements leading to loss of mechanical resistance to deformation. The tearing & fracture response of a viscoelastic material using a notch-in-plate sample deformed in simple tension is also simulated. By comparing the simulation results for a local damage criterion versus a truly nonlocal damage criterion, we show how the spread of Gibbs free energy around the crack tip influences the nature of the crack growth. As expected, the material fracture response described by a local damage criterion exhibits pathological mesh dependence whereas the response obtained using the nonlocal damage criterion is mesh objective regardless of mesh density, element type and orientation. This work presents two major computational advances: (1) the conversion of the rate form-based finite-deformation constitutive theory into an objective time-integration procedure is straightforward because the material time derivative-based constitutive equations are frame-invariant, and (2) the physically-observed crack initiation & propagation process in solids can be accurately & robustly simulated using simple numerical techniques such as the element failure method if a truly nonlocal fracture criterion is utilized. Finally, we benchmark results obtained from our computational framework and numerical simulations for modeling crack initiation & propagation to physical experimental data of mixed-mode crack propagation in a viscoelastic material.},

   abstract = {This work presents a new phase field model for rate-independent crack propagation in rubbery polymers at large strains and considers details of its numerical implementation. The approach accounts for micro-mechanically based features of both the elastic bulk response as well as the crack toughness of idealized polymer networks. The proposed diffusive crack modeling based on the introduction of a crack phase field overcomes difficulties associated with the computational realization of sharp crack discontinuities, in particular when it comes to complex crack topologies. The crack phase field governs a crack density function, which describes the macroscopic crack surface in the polymer per unit of the reference volume. It provides the basis for the constitutive modeling of a degrading free energy storage and a crack threshold function with a Griffith-type critical energy release rate, that governs the crack propagation in the polymer. Both the energy storage as well as the critical energy release due to fracture can be related to classical statistical network theories of polymers. The proposed framework of diffusive fracture in polymers is formulated in terms of a rate-type variational principle that determines the evolution of the coupled primary variable fields, i.e. the deformation field and the crack phase field. On the computational side, we outline a staggered solution procedure based on a one-pass operator split of the coupled equations, that successively updates in a typical time step the crack phase field and the displacement field. Such a solution algorithm is extremely robust, easy to implement and ideally suited for engineering problems. We finally demonstrate the performance of the phase field formulation of fracture at large strains by means of representative numerical examples. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

   abstract = {A new viscoelastic cohesive zone model is formulated for large deformation conditions and within a fully coupled thermomechanical framework. The model is suitable for the simulation of a wide range of problems especially for polymeric materials. It can capture viscoelastic crack propagation as well as energy dissipation due to this process. Starting from the principles of thermodynamics, a 3D finite element formulation is derived for a fully coupled simultaneous solution of the thermal field and the deformation field. The viscoelastic model is constructed by extending an elastic exponential traction separation law using a simple rheology. The viscous part of the tractions is postulated to have the same characteristic length as the elastic part and that they are related by a single material parameter. A Newtonian dashpot is used to describe the evolution of the viscous separation. Furthermore, thermal effects are accounted for using temperature expressions in both the traction laws and the viscosity of the dashpot, and using a heat conduction law across the interface. The model is implemented within an implicit finite element code and the internal variable is calculated using an internal iteration. Different numerical examples are used to verify the model and a comparison with experimental data shows a satisfactory agreement. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {Several published papers deal with the possibility of replacing a damage finite element model by a combination of cohesive zones and finite elements. The focus of the paper is to show under which conditions this change of model can be done in an energy-wise manner. The objective is to build a cohesive model based on a known damage model, without making any assumption on the shape of the cohesive law. The method is characterized, on the one hand, by the use of a well-defined thermodynamic framework for the cohesive model and, on the other hand, by the idea that the main quantity which must be maintained through the change of model is the energy dissipated by the structure. An analysis of the stability criteria enables us to determine the domains of validity of the different models. Thus, we show that it is consistent to derive the cohesive law from a given nonlocal damage model because the occurrence of a discontinuity can be viewed as an alternative way to limit localization. The method is illustrated on one-dimensional examples and a numerical resolution method for the problem with a cohesive zone is presented. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {The mechanical behavior of elastomeric materials is known to be rate-dependent and to exhibit hysteresis upon cyclic loading. Although these features of the rubbery constitutive response are well-recognized and important to its function, few models attempt to quantify these aspects of response perhaps due to the complex nature of the behavior and its apparent inconsistency with regard to current reasonably successful models of rubber elasticity. In this paper a detailed experimental investigation probing the material response of carbon black filled Chloroprene rubber subjected to different time-dependent strain histories is presented. Some of the key observations from the experiments, are: (1) both filled and unfilled elastomers show significant amounts of hysteresis during cyclic loading; (2) the amount of carbon black particles does not strongly influence the normalized amount of hysteresis; (3) both filled and unfilled elastomers are strain-rate dependent and the rate dependence is higher during the uploading than during the unloading; (4) at fixed strain, the stress is observed to approach the same equilibrium level with relaxation time whether loading or unloading. Based on the experimental data a new constitutive model has been developed. The foundation of the model is that the mechanical behavior can be decomposed into two parts: an equilibrium network corresponding to the state that is approached in long time stress relaxation tests; and a second network capturing the non-linear rate-dependent deviation from the equilibrium state. The time-dependence of the second network is further assumed to be governed by the reptational motion of molecules having the ability to significantly change conformation and thereby relaxing the overall stress state. By comparing the predictions from the proposed three-dimensional constitutive model with experimental data for uniaxial compression and plane strain compression we conclude that the constitutive model predicts rate-dependence and relaxation behavior well. © 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd.

   abstract = {This paper addresses the applicability of the Time-Temperature Superposition Principle in the dynamic response of a polyurea polymer at high strain rates and different temperatures. Careful and extensive measurements in the time domain of the relaxation behavior and subsequent deduction of a master-relaxation curve establish the mechanical behavior for quasistatic deformations over a time range of 16 decades. To examine its validity in a highly dynamic environment, experiments with the aid of a split Hopkinson (Kolsky) pressure bar are carried out. The use of a two-material pulse shaper allows for stress equilibrium across the specimen during the compression process, to concentrate on the initial, small deformation part that characterizes linearly viscoelastic behavior. This behavior of polyurea at high strain rates and different temperatures is then investigated by comparing results from a physically fully three-dimensional (axisymmetric) numerical model, employing the quasistatically obtained properties, with corresponding Hopkinson bar measurements. The experimentally determined wave history entering the specimen is used as input to the model. Experimental and simulation results are compared with each other to demonstrate that the Time-Temperature Superposition Principle can indeed provide the requisite data for high strain rate loading of viscoelastic solids, at least to the extent that linear viscoelasticity applies with respect to the polyurea material. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

   abstract = {This paper presents a novel rate-dependent cohesive-zone model combining damage and visco-elasticity and based on two fundamental assumptions. Firstly we postulate the existence of an intrinsic (i.e. rate-independent) fracture energy. Secondly, within a thermodynamically consistent damage-mechanics framework we assume that the evolution of the damage variable is related to the current free energy and to the intrinsic fracture energy. The underlying idea is that the energy of the bonds at the micro-level is rate-independent and that the rate-dependence of the overall dissipated energy during crack propagation is a natural by-product of the visco-elastic dissipation lumped on the zero-thickness interface. Quite good agreement within an expected range of loading rates was obtained between numerical and experimental results for a DCB specimen with steel arms bonded through a rubber interface. This is despite the fact that for this application the model has been kept as simple as possible using a quadratic elastic energy and linear visco-elasticity with one relaxation time only. Therefore, the presented results support the fundamental principles behind the proposed approach and indicate that the model has the potential to be refined into a highly accurate tool of analysis based on sound physical arguments. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

An in vitro model was used to simulate a vertical force at the interdental wire. Twenty-six pairs of incisors were placed in two groups. A 15 mm length of wire was bonded to the lingual surfaces of each pair of incisors using a common bonding technique. A vertical force was applied to the midpoint of the interdental wire, using an Instron universal testing machine. The failure characteristics examined included the maximum force for debond, the degree of wire deformation, and the site of failure.Significance was predetermined at P < 0.05 and multiple comparisons indicated no significant differences (P = 0.147) in the initial mean bond strength between the 0.0175 inch (41.44 N) and 0.016 × 0.022 inch (37.70 N) wires. The main failure type for both the initial and second debond events was fracture of composite bond at the wire-composite interface, cohesive failure. Both wires exhibited similar mean degrees of deflection of 1.30 and 1.51 mm for the 0.0175 inch and 0.016 × 0.022 inch wires, respectively.

   abstract = {This paper presents a finite element study of cohesive crack growth in a thin infinite viscoelastic strip to investigate the effects of viscoelastic properties, strip height, and cohesive model parameters on the crack growth resistance. The results of the study show that the dependence of the fracture energy on the viscoelastic properties for the strip problem is similar to that obtained for the infinite body problem even when the cohesive zone length is large compared to the height of the strip. The fracture energy also depends on the crack speed v through the dimensionless parameter vτ/L∞ where L∞ is the characteristic length of the cohesive zone and τ is the characteristic relaxation time of the bulk material. This relationship confirms that at least two properties of the fracture process must be prescribed accurately to model viscoelastic crack growth. In contrast, the fracture energy and crack speed are insensitive to the strip height even in situations where the growth of the dissipation zone is severely constrained by the strip boundaries. We observe that at high speeds, where the fracture energy asymptotically approaches the maximum value, the material surrounding the cohesive zone is in the rubbery (equilibrium) state and not the glassy state. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2006.},

For a finite size specimen however such prediction are no longer strictly valid. We demonstrate here that there is a maximum viscoelastic energy dissipation (and thus fracture toughness) at a characteristic interface crack velocity which depends not only on the micromechanical properties of the interface and the viscoelastic properties of the bulk polymers but also upon the specimen dimensions. Our analytical results allow us to deduce G=Gad[1+φ (aTȧ,c)] which relates the experimental fracture toughness to the intrinsic fracture toughness of the interface Gad, the WLF shift factor aT and c, a dimensionless parameter which is a function of the micromechanical properties of the interface, the mechanical properties of the polymers and the specimen dimensions. This result is similar to an empirical relation developed to fit experimental results; this relation however was assumed to be independent of c (specimen geometry). We demonstrate that the dependence of φ on c is substantially weaker than its dependence on a Tȧ, which accounts for the success of the empirical relation in correlating the experimental data.},

   abstract = {The problem of adhesion at the interface between two polymers is investigated using a fracture mechanics approach. The effect of viscoelastic deformation of the bulk polymers and the micromechanical behavior of the interface on the fracture toughness of the interface was investigated by analyzing the problem of a steadily growing interface crack under the condition of small scale yielding. This condition assumes that the region of displacement discontinuity across the interface (the adhesive zone) due to loss of adhesion is small compared with typical specimen dimensions. It is found that the amount of inelastic or viscous energy dissipation is strongly coupled to the interface behavior and that the measured interface fracture toughness can be much higher than the intrinsic interface fracture toughness. For sufficiently high crack growth rates, a simple expression is obtained which relates the rate of viscous energy dissipation and the intrinsic interface fracture toughness to the viscoelastic properties of the bulk polymer. The dependence of the stress field inside the adhesive zone and the length of the adhesive zone on the viscoelastic properties of the polymer, the applied loading, the interface micromechanical model and the crack growth rate ȧ is obtained by numerically solving an integral equation. The size of the region of the viscoelastic energy dissipation is found to scale with ȧτr, where τris the retardation time of the bulk polymer.},

   abstract = {Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to evaluate current simulation capabilities for thin film delamination on the basis of real test data as well as a contribution to its extension in order to partly substitute experimental investigations. Design/methodology/approach - The proposed model consists of a formulation that describes the behaviour of the bulk material and an approach that introduces the film's delamination capability. An implicit finite element framework with a cohesive zone implementation is used and described in detail. The numerical results on the basis of the a priori identified material parameters are related to the experimental work. In order to capture the obvious peel speed dependency of these delamination processes, a viscoelastic cohesive formulation is introduced and compared with a pure separation rate dependent cohesive material in the second part of this contribution. Findings - The performed numerical simulations show a good approximation of the experimental peel process. The extension in order to take time-dependent effects into account is required for the simulation of such problems. In contrast with the pure rate-dependent model, the presented consistent formulation of the cohesive part is able to cover the whole range of observed material phenomena. Research limitations/implications - Owing to the absence of suitable experimental single mode investigations of the sealed layer, the used cohesive material parameters are identified in relation to the pre-existing experimental results. Furthermore, the resultant peel force has a constant value due to the assumed homogeneous cohesive material and therefore gives only a mean approximation of the experimental values at this stage of the investigation. Originality/value - The numerical representation of such a thin film delamination process in relation to real experimental results shows the additional capabilities and the usability of the implicit finite element method with a cohesive zone implementation in a clear and illustrative way. The first proposed cohesive extension based on a rheological model shows the capability to cover the full range of time-dependent interface layer behaviour. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

Considering fast loading, experimental evidence indicates a strong relationship between the rate of strain and the material's resistance against fracture, which can be considered by a dynamic increase factor for the strength of the material. The paper at hand presents a novel approach within the framework of phase-field models for brittle fracture. A rate-dependent fracture toughness is formulated as a function of the rate of crack driving strain components, which results in higher strength for faster loading. Beside the increased amount of energy necessary to evolve a crack at a high strain rate loading situation, the model incorporates quasi-viscous stress-type quantities that are not directly related to the formation of the crack and exist only in the phase-field transition zone between broken and sound material. The governing strong form equations for a transient simulation are derived and the relevant information for an implementation of the model into a finite element code is outlined in detail. The performance of the model is demonstrated for static and dynamic benchmark simulations and for a comparison to experimental findings.},

Good agreement is obtained by comparing the results of simulations and experiments. Most elastomers exhibit both elastic and viscous behavior simultaneously, which yields rate-dependent properties for both the mechanical and fracture responses. In this contribution, a viscoelastic rheological model based on Reese and Govindjee (Int J Solids Struct 35:3455–3482, 1998) is coupled to phase-field modeling to investigate rate-dependent fracture within elastomers. The elastic strain energy potential supposed to evolve fracture is provided by both the equilibrium and non-equilibrium branches. The fracture mechanism is characterized by a volumetric–isochoric split, which specifies a varying driving force in the case of tensile or compressive deformation. Representative numerical examples are studied and related findings and potential perspectives are summarized to close the paper.},

In particular, elastomeric solids which are of essential engineering interest are discussed. In order to simulate the significant different bulk/shear-response of polymeric media the deformation is decomposed into volumetric elastic and isochoric viscoelastic parts. The constitutive equations are presented within the context of internal variable models and a Lagrangian kinematical description is adopted throughout. For sufficiently slow processes the material responds in a rubbery elastic manner which is assumed to be modelled with an Ogden-type strain energy function well-known from rubber elasticity. The stresses and the symmetric consistent tangent moduli are briefly discussed along with a second-order approximation of the constitutive rate equation. The main thrust of this paper on the computational side is to show the meaningful time-dependent behaviour and the general applicability of the three-dimensional constitutive model. By applying assumed enhanced strain elements which are wellsuited for (nearly) incompressible problems three representative numerical examples illustrate relaxation and creeping phenomena at large strains and the equilibrium finite elastic response, which is asymptotically obtained.},

We extend the model to depend on the loading rate and time by incorporating rubber's strain-rate dependency in the constitutive description of the bulk, as well as in the damage driving force. The parameters of the model are identified using experiments at different strain rates. Local strain fields near the crack tip, obtained with digital image correlation (DIC), are used to help identify the length scale parameter. Three different degradation functions are assessed for their accuracy to model the rubber's rate-dependent fracture. An adaptive time-stepping approach with a corrector scheme is furthermore employed to increase the computational efficiency with a factor of six, whereas an active set method guarantees the irreversibility of damage. Results detailing the energy storage and dissipation of the different model constituents are included, as well as validation results that show promising capabilities of rate-dependent phase-field modeling.},

   abstract = {A cohesive zone model was used in conjunction with the finite volume method to model the dynamic fracture of single edge notched tensile specimens of PMMA under essentially static loading conditions. In this study, the influence of the shape of the cohesive law was investigated, whilst keeping the cohesive strength and separation energy constant. Cohesive cells were adaptively inserted between adjacent continuum cells when the normal traction across that face exceeded the cohesive strength of the material. The cohesive constitutive law was therefore initially rigid, and the effective elasticity of the material was unaltered prior to insertion of the cohesive cells. Notch depths ranging from 2.0 to 0.1 mm were considered. The numerical predictions were compared with experimental observations for each notch depth and excellent qualitative and quantitative agreement was achieved in most cases. Following an initial period of rapid crack tip acceleration up to terminal velocities well below the Rayleigh wave speed, subsequent propagation took place at a constant rate under conditions of increasing energy flux to an expanding process region. In addition, attempted and successful branching was predicted for the shorter notches. It was found that the shape of the cohesive law had a significant influence on the dynamic fracture behaviour. In particular, the value of the initial slope of the softening function was found to be an important parameter. As the slope became steeper, the predicted terminal crack speed increased and the extent of the damage decreased. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {The constitutive relations for the transport of heat, stress, electric charge, etc., in a continuum must be chosen so that the second law of thermodynamics is not violated; the constraints take the form of inequalities, typically requiring the entropy generated within a material element to be non-negative. The paper is concerned with this concept-its history, the physical principles on which it depends, how to apply it when second-order or non-linear effects are important and how it is widely misused in modern continuum mechanics.The history is reduced to the contributions of five leading thermodynamicists-Clausius, Maxwell, Gibbs, Boltzmann and Duhem. The object here was to try to discover which form of the inequality one should regard as being fundamental. One important conclusion is that entropy S must be defined simultaneously with the identification of the inequality, and that in general this cannot be done until the constitutive equations are known. The empirical element enters with the notion of irreversibility, which is given a precise meaning with the aid of the motion reversed parity η(x), a variable x having η = +1 or η = -1 if, when time and motions are reversed, x → x or x → -x. The macroscopic parity of x, η*(x), is obtained by first replacing x by the constitutive equation for x.The entropy production rate Σ has both irreversible Σ(f) and reversible Σ(r) parts. It is shown that the reciprocal relations follow from the requirement that the macroscopic parity of Σ(i) must be +1.Continuum thermodynamics is based on various principles extracted from theory developed for uniform systems, the example chosen to illustrate the ideas being the simple monatomic gas. Second-order constitutive relations are introduced, and the expressions for entropy and its production rate per unit volume, σ, obtained. It is shown that the stability condition σ ≥ 0 cannot, in general, be satisfied merely by imposing constraints on the constitutive relations. To second-order σ = σ1 + σ2, where σ1 is the usual bilinear form, and the terms in σ2 have an additional derivative. The second-order term σ2 can have both signs, and is not dissipative. The relation between this fact and the frame-dependence of constitutive relations is explained.The final section illustrates the errors frequently found in the thermodynamic arguments appearing in books and papers on rational continuum mechanics. The principle of these is that σ ≥ 0 is interpreted as being a constraint on the constitutive relations alone. Another is the idea that the balance equations can be set aside as constraints by regarding them as mere definitions of a heat source and a body force, an error based partly on the misconception that constitutive relations should be frame-indifferent. Finally, an inequality due to Glansdorff & Prigogine is examined and found to be in error. © 1982 Academic Press Inc. (London) Limited.},

   abstract = {The paper contains a synthesis of recent developments that have extended the domain of validity of the classical version of thermodynamics of irreversible processes and generalized its methods. The presentation is largely based on the recognition of the factthat the real, nonequilibrium state of a material particle undergoing an irreversible process always remains close to a properly selected constrained equilibrium state — known as the accompanying state — which is described by the usual variables (deformation gradient and internal energy) and an adequate set of internal variables to which a physical meaning can be attached. The selection of these internal variables depends on the intended level of description and on the pair material-process being analyzed. The preceding circumstances allow us to write down a Gibbs equation for the accompanying state of the system which, together with the conservation laws, makes it possible to calculate the volumetric rate of production of accompanying entropy. It is recognized that the latter must be nonnegative in all processes (fundamental inequality of dissipation). The generalized forces and fluxes which appear in this expression are functionally related, the state variables occurring in them in the role of parameters. It is shown that the forces or fluxes must appear in a form consisting of two parts. One part is derivable from a potential of dissipation the other part being nondissipative. The paper recalls the linear form of Onsager’s relations and discusses the possibility of their generalization to nonlinear constitutive relations. Even though such a firm generalization does not yet exist, it is possible to discuss two plausible proposals and to examine the relations that link them to each other. The totality of postulates discussed in the paper constitutes a complete thermodynamic formalism. It is shown that Meixner’s fundamental inequality is implied in this formalism and this provides a physical interpretation for his second temperature. Furthermore, the elimination of the internal variables leads to the formalism known as “rational” thermodynamics in which the constitutive relations are given in the form of functionals. This permits us to give a physical interpretation to the concepts of nonequilibrium temperature and entropy considered as “primitive” in “rational” thermodynamics. © Copyright by Walter de Gruyter & Co.},

Crystallization seems to be an important factor in determining the tear behavior since it has not been found possible to tear unvulcanized SBR under the same conditions. The effect of the pronounced imperfect elastic nature of the material was studied under conditions where the driving force for tearing was solely governed by the rate of release of elastic energy.

   abstract = {Acoustoelastic analysis has usually been applied to compressible engineering materials. Many materials (e.g., rubber and biologic materials) are "nearly" incompressible and often assumed incompressible in their constitutive equations. These material models do not admit dilatational waves for acoustoelastic analysis. Other constitutive models (for these materials) admit compressibility but still do not model dilatational waves with fidelity (shown herein). In this article a new strain energy function is formulated to model dilatational wave propagation in nearly incompressible, isotropic materials. This strain energy function requires four material constants and is a function of Cauchy-Green deformation tensor invariants. This function and existing (compressible) strain energy functions are compared based upon their ability to predict dilatational wave propagation in uniaxially prestressed rubber. Results demonstrate deficiencies in existing functions and the usefulness of our new function for acoustoelastic applications.

   abstract = {Impact responses of extra-soft materials, such as ballistic gelatins and biological tissues, are increasingly in demand. The Kolsky bar is a widely used device to characterize high-rate behavior of materials. When a Kolsky bar is used to determine the dynamic compressive response of an extra-soft specimen, a spike-like feature often appears in the initial portion of the measured stress history. It is important to distinguish whether this spike is an experimental artifact or an intrinsic material response. In this research, we examined this phenomenon using experimental, numerical and analytical methods. The results indicate that the spike is the extra stress from specimen radial inertia during the acceleration stage of the axial deformation. Based on this understanding, remedies in both specimen geometry and loading pulse to minimize the artifact are proposed and verified, and thus capture the intrinsic dynamic behavior of the specimen material. © Society for Experimental Mechanics 2007.},

   abstract = {Elastomers and soft biological tissues can undergo large deformations and exhibit time dependent behavior that is characteristic of nonlinear viscoelastic solids. This article is intended to provide an overview of the subject of nonlinear viscoelastic solids for researchers who are interested in studying the mechanics of these materials. The article begins with a review of topics from linear viscoelasticity that are pertinent to the understanding of nonlinear viscoelastic behavior. It then discusses the topics that enter into the formulation of constitutive equations for isotropic, transversely isotropic and orthotropic nonlinear viscoelastic solids. A number of specific forms of constitutive equations have been proposed in the literature and these are discussed. Attention is restricted to constitutive equations that are phenomenological rather than molecular in origin. The emphasis is then on nonlinear single integral finite linear viscoelastic and Pipkin-Rogers constitutive equations, the latter containing the quasi-linear viscoelastic model used in biomechanics of soft tissue. Expressions for the Pipkin-Rogers model are provided for isotropy, transverse isotropy and orthotropy. The constitutive equations are thenapplied to the description of homogeneous triaxial stretch and simple shear histories. The special case of uniaxial stretch histories is analyzed in detail. There is a discussion of the deviation from linear behavior as nonlinear effects become important. Non-homogeneous deformations are considered next. The combined tension and torsion of a solid cylinder on an incompressible, isotropic nonlinear viscoelastic solid is discussed in detail because of its importance in experiments involving viscoelastic materials. A large number of solutions to boundary value problems have appeared in the literature and many of these are summarized. The article concludes with comments about interesting topics for further research. © 2009 SAGE Publications.},

   abstract = {It is by now well established that loading conditions with sufficiently large triaxialities can induce the sudden appearance of internal cavities within elastomeric (and other soft) solids. The occurrence of such instabilities, commonly referred to as cavitation, can be attributed to the growth of pre-existing defects into finite sizes. This paper introduces a new theory to study the phenomenon of cavitation in soft solids that: (i) allows to consider general 3D loading conditions with arbitrary triaxiality, (ii) applies to large (including compressible and anisotropic) classes of nonlinear elastic solids, and (iii) incorporates direct information on the initial shape, spatial distribution, and mechanical properties of the underlying defects at which cavitation can initiate. The basic idea is to first cast cavitation in elastomeric solids as a homogenization problem of nonlinear elastic materials containing random distributions of zero-volume cavities, or defects. This problem is then addressed by means of a novel iterated homogenization procedure, which allows to construct solutions for a specific, yet fairly general, class of defects. These include solutions for the change in size of the defects as a function of the applied loading conditions, from which the onset of cavitation - corresponding to the event when the initially infinitesimal defects suddenly grown into finite sizes - can be readily determined. In spite of the generality of the proposed approach, the relevant calculations amount to solving tractable HamiltonJacobi equations, in which the initial size of the defects plays the role of time and the applied load plays the role of space. When specialized to the case of hydrostatic loading conditions, isotropic solids, and defects that are vacuous and isotropically distributed, the proposed theory recovers the classical result of Ball (1982) for radially symmetric cavitation. The nature and implications of this remarkable connection are discussed in detail. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Continuum mechanics allows one to establish constitutive relations, deducing them from a single pair of scalar functions characterizing the material. The simplest materials dealt with in continuum mechanics are elastic. More general processes and those taking place in more general materials are irreversible and require more constitutive relations, connecting the dissipative forces with the velocities. The orthogonality condition and the equivalent extremum principles have been established for velocities in the form of vectors or symmetric tensors. It is found that if the deformation of an elastic body is neither isothermal nor adiabatic, the strain tensor has to be supplemented by the additional independent state variable. The connection between stress and elastic strain is given by the generalized Hooke's law and connects the stress with the plastic strain and its time rate. It is found that orthogonality in velocity space, which is essentially responsible for the results, does not necessarily imply orthogonality in force space. © 1987, Academic Press Inc.},

The three-dimensional material law is applicable to the thermomechanical characterization of elastomeric (high-polymeric) solids in the finite strain domain under varying temperature. The description is based on the concept of internal state variables and rational thermodynamics. The main goal of the presentation is to develop consistent constitutive equations for the stress, entropy and independent internal variables such that the second law of thermodynamics, in the form of the Clausius-Duhem inequality, is satisfied. Motivated by the significant difference in bulk and shear response of elastomers, the model employs a local decomposition of the deformation into a dilatational and an isochoric part. The framework of nonlinear thermoviscoelasticity presented herein is formulated entirely in the reference configuration and provides a sound continuum basis for approximation techniques such as the Finite-Element method.

   abstract = {A computational modeling technique for fracture propagation in viscoelastic materials using cohesive elements for the zone ahead of the crack tip is presented. The computational technique is used to study the problem of increase in fracture energy with peel velocity in peel testing of polymers. A rate-independent phenomenological cohesive zone model is used to model the intrinsic fracture toughness of the interface between the polymer sheets. A dimensional analysis reveals that the macroscopic fracture energy scales with the intrinsic fracture toughness and is a function of peel velocity, and parameters such as the thickness, bulk properties of the polymer sheets, and other cohesive zone properties. The growth of fracture energy as a function of the peel velocity has been studied for polymer sheets characterized by a standard linear viscoelastic solid. Viscoelastic losses in the peel arm vanish in the limits of very slow and rapid peeling. Peak dissipation is obtained at an intermediate velocity, which is related to the characteristic relaxation time and thickness. This behavior is interpreted in terms of the size of elastic and viscous zones near the crack tip. It is found that the total energy dissipated is dependent upon both the intrinsic fracture toughness and the characteristic opening displacement of the cohesive zone model. The computational framework has been used to model experimental data on peeling of Butadiene rubbers. It is found that the usual interpretation of these data, that the macroscopic dissipation equals the rate-independent intrinsic toughness multiplied by a factor that depends on rate of loading, leads to a large quantitative discrepancy between theory and experiment. It is proposed that a model based on a rate-dependent cohesive law be used to model these peel tests. © 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Inasmuch as such a study requires sufficient bond strength to control the orientation of crack propagation , this paper deals with the characterization of interface strength. Following earlier analysis of crack propagation in homogeneous and bimaterial viscoelastic solids, experimental studies concerned with rate dependent fracture at the interface are evaluated in terms of the viscoelastic functions associated with homogeneous fracture of the adherends and a separate interface-intrinsic strength which is determined by the chemistry at the interface. This interface strength multiplies a viscoelastic function, which, for the interface problem, is a combination of the properties of the homogeneous solids. Interface strength on the same order as those of the adherends is achieved.

The stored energy is composed of distinct anisotropic equilibrated and non-equilibrated parts. The nonequilibrated strains are obtained from the multiplicative decomposition of the deformation gradient. The procedure can be considered as an extension of the Reese and Govindjee framework to anisotropic materials and reduces to such formulation for isotropic materials. The stress-point algorithmic implementation is based on an elastic-predictor viscous-corrector algorithm similar to that employed in plasticity.

   abstract = {The near field ground motion signatures associated with sub-Rayleigh and supershear ruptures are investigated using the laboratory earthquake experiment originally developed by Rosakis and coworkers (Xia et al., 2004, 2005a; Lu et al., 2007; Rosakis et al., 2007). Heterodyne laser interferometers enable continuous, high bandwidth measurements of fault-normal (FN) and fault-parallel (FP) particle velocity "ground motion" records at discrete locations on the surface of a Homalite test specimen as a sub-Rayleigh or a supershear rupture sweeps along the frictional fault. Photoelastic interference fringes, acquired using high-speed digital photography, provide a synchronized, spatially resolved, whole field view of the advancing rupture tip and surrounding maximum shear stress field. Experimental results confirm that near field ground motion records associated with the passage of a sub-Rayleigh rupture are characterized by a FN velocity swing which dominates over the FP velocity swing. The situation is shown to reverse in the supershear rupture speed regime whereby the motion along the shear Mach front is characterized by a FP particle velocity swing which dominates over the FN velocity swing. Additional distinguishing particle velocity signatures, consistent with theoretical and numerical predictions, and repeatedly observed in experimental records are (1) a pronounced peak in the FP velocity record, induced by the leading dilatational field, which sweeps the measurement station just prior to the arrival of the shear Mach front, and (2) a pronounced velocity swing in the FN record associated with the arrival of a "trailing Rayleigh disturbance", which sweeps the measurement station following passage of the shear Mach front. Each of these features are addressed in detail. We conclude by reexamining the 2002, Mw7.9 Denali fault earthquake and the remarkable set of ground motion records obtained at Pump Station 10 (PS10), located approximately 85km east of the epicenter and 3km north of the fault along the Alaska Pipeline. Motivated by the analysis and thorough interpretation of these records by Dunham and Archuleta (2004, 2005), we attempt to replicate the Denali ground motion signatures using a laboratory earthquake experiment. The experiments feature a left (west) to right (east) propagating right lateral rupture within the Homalite test specimen with particle velocity data collected at a near-field station situated just above (north of) the fault, (on the compressional quadrant) in order to simulate the PS10 scenario. Both sub-Rayleigh and supershear laboratory earthquake experiments are conducted using the "Denali PS10" configuration in order to compare and contrast the resulting particle velocity signatures. Results from the supershear experiment capture the prominent FN and FP ground motion signatures and corresponding sense of particle motion revealed in the PS10 ground motion records. Most notably, the particle velocity records feature a dominant FP component coinciding with the arrival of the shear Mach front, followed by a pronounced velocity swing in the FN component coinciding with the passage of a trailing Rayleigh disturbance, as independently confirmed by the presence of these features and their noted arrival times in the synchronized photoelastic image sequence. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

   abstract = {The roles of the consistent Jacobian matrix and the material tangent moduli, which are used in nonlinear incremental finite deformation mechanics problems solved using the finite element method, are emphasized in this paper, and demonstrated using the commercial software ABAQUS standard. In doing so, the necessity for correctly employing user material subroutines to solve nonlinear problems involving large deformation and/or large rotation is clarified. Starting with the rate form of the principle of virtual work, the derivations of the material tangent moduli, the consistent Jacobian matrix, the stress/strain measures, and the objective stress rates are discussed and clarified. The difference between the consistent Jacobian matrix (which, in the ABAQUS UMAT user material subroutine is referred to as DDSDDE) and the material tangent moduli (Ce) needed for the stress update is pointed out and emphasized in this paper. While the former is derived based on the Jaumann rate of the Kirchhoff stress, the latter is derived using the Jaumann rate of the Cauchy stress. Understanding the difference between these two objective stress rates is crucial for correctly implementing a constitutive model, especially a rate form constitutive relation, and for ensuring fast convergence. Specifically, the implementation requires the stresses to be updated correctly. For this, the strains must be computed directly from the deformation gradient and corresponding strain measure (for a total form model). Alternatively, the material tangent moduli derived from the corresponding Jaumann rate of the Cauchy stress of the constitutive relation (for a rate form model) should be used. Given that this requirement is satisfied, the consistent Jacobian matrix only influences the rate of convergence. Its derivation should be based on the Jaumann rate of the Kirchhoff stress to ensure fast convergence; however, the use of a different objective stress rate may also be possible. The error associated with energy conservation and work-conjugacy due to the use of the Jaumann objective stress rate in ABAQUS nonlinear incremental analysis is viewed as a consequence of the implementation of a constitutive model that violates these requirements.},

This case is characterized by large, inelastic deformation that is difficult to model using classical fracture mechanics and analytic cohesive zone approaches. The formulation allows simulation of crack growth in the presence of large global strains and the identification of peak viscous loss zones in the peel arms. The second case study is the analysis of a compressive shear test to determine adhesion between a viscoelastic elastomer and a rigid substrate. An experimentally observed transition from stable to unstable fracture is described accurately by the model, providing appropriate cohesive zone parameters are established. The third example treats interfacial failure in a multilayer elasto-plastic polymer system.

   abstract = {This paper presents some developments related to the idea of covariance in elasticity. The geometric point of view in continuum mechanics is briefly reviewed. Building on this, regarding the reference configuration and the ambient space as Riemannian manifolds with their own metrics, a Lagrangian field theory of elastic bodies with evolving reference configurations is developed. It is shown that even in this general setting, the Euler-Lagrange equations resulting from horizontal (referential) variations are equivalent to those resulting from vertical (spatial) variations. The classical Green-Naghdi-Rivilin theorem is revisited and a material version of it is discussed. It is shown that energy balance, in general, cannot be invariant under isometries of the reference configuration, which in this case is identified with a subset of R3. Transformation properties of balance of energy under rigid translations and rotations of the reference configuration is obtained. The spatial covariant theory of elasticity is also revisited. The transformation of balance of energy under an arbitrary diffeomorphism of the reference configuration is obtained and it is shown that some nonstandard terms appear in the transformed balance of energy. Then conditions under which energy balance is materially covariant are obtained. It is seen that material covariance of energy balance is equivalent to conservation of mass, isotropy, material Doyle-Ericksen formula and an extra condition that we call configurational inviscidity. In the last part of the paper, the connection between Noether's theorem and covariance is investigated. It is shown that the Doyle-Ericksen formula can be obtained as a consequence of spatial covariance of Lagrangian density. Similarly, it is shown that the material Doyle-Ericksen formula can be obtained from material covariance of Lagrangian density. © 2006 American Institute of Physics.},

@article{Haupt2002,
   abstract = {The assumption of incompressibility as a kinematic constraint condition leads to consequences, which are of physical interest in view of a thermodynamically consistent material modelling. Some of these consequences are discussed within the concept of finite linear viscoelasticity. We present two natural possibilities to generalise the familiar Maxwell-model to finite strains; both tensor-valued differential equations are integrated to yield the present Cauchy stress as a functional of the relative Piola or Green strain history. Both types of Maxwell-models are related to a free energy functional in the sense that the dissipation inequality is satisfied. The stress and energy functionals are generalised to incorporate arbitrary kernel functions of relaxation; the only restriction for thermodynamic consistency is that the relaxation functions have a negative slope and a positive curvature. The linear combination of the two types of energy functionals can be understood to be a generalisation of the Mooney-Rivlin model to viscoelasticity. The concrete representation of relaxation functions, motivated from a finite series of Maxwell-elements in parallel, implies a Prony series, corresponding to a discrete relaxation spectrum. A compact notation to express a continuous relaxation spectrum is provided by the concept of a derivative of fractional order. In particular, differential equations of fractional order lead to relaxation functions coming very close to the relaxation behaviour of real materials. As an example, the evolution equation of a fractional Maxwell-model is solved, leading to a relaxation function of the Mittag-Leffler type. An essential advantage is that a rather small number of material constants is involved in this model, while the accuracy of its prediction is quite good. Physically nonlinear effects, such as process-dependent viscosity and relaxation behaviour can be incorporated into finite linear viscoelasticity, if the natural time is replaced with a material-dependent time scale. The rate of the material-dependent time then depends on further internal variables to account for the influence of the process history; this kind of proceeding is fully compatible with the entropy inequality. Temperature-dependence is included, starting from a multiplicative decomposition of the deformation gradient into mechanical and thermal parts. The resulting constitutive theory has a rather simple structure and offers a considerable degree of freedom to allow for physically important phenomena. The numerical simulations illustrate a small selection of these possibilities.},

More special is the term "dual variables" which has been introduced in connection with incremental constitutive relations of hypoelasticity and plasticity, where the rates of both tensors arise. We propose a rational rule from which the most natural form of tensor-valued kinematic and dynamic variables (strain and stress tensors) including their corresponding time rates can be deduced. Dual variables and their associated dual derivatives are characterized by the property that apart from the stress power also the incremental stress power is invariant under a group of transformations that corresponds to a set of physically reasonable intermediate configurations. We outline the precursory history of these concepts and then discuss in detail how the invariance properties can be realized in the various stress and strain measures.

Furthermore, it is shown how the two decompositions of deformation may be generalized to finite deformations in the framework of a multi-plicative decomposition of the deformation gradient tensor. This enables to assign to each version of the three-parameter solids a corresponding class of finite deformation counterparts. Note that the finite deformation models are derived so, that the second law of thermodynamics is satisfied for every admissible process. To this end, use is made of the so-called Mandel stress tensor. As one may expect, unlike the linear case, the finite deformation models obtained do not predict identical mechanical responses generally. This is illustrated for the loading case of uniaxial tension-compression. Also, an analysis of the model responses for simple shear is given.},

The stress has a linear-upturn power-law relation with the strain, resulting in an elastic modulus, and consequently a wave speed, that increase with the strain. Though appearing to be "supersonic", the local wave speed in the crack tip vicinity of the solid with a sufficient upturn stress-strain relation exceeds the crack extension speed. A pre-request for such a supersonic crack growth is the storage of sufficient deformation energy within the solid to nurse the energy flux drawn to the crack tip that extends at an "apparent supersonic" speed. The idea is demonstrated for the simplest case, the anti-plane shear. We examine the steady-state supersonic crack growth in a hyperelastic material. The governing equation is elliptical in the crack tip vicinity but hyperbolic elsewhere. The boundary between two regions is determined with a certain extent. An asymptotic solution is constructed within the super-hardening zone. The solution connects to the hyperbolic radiation strips by weak discontinuity boundaries and to the pre-stressed frontal field by a strong discontinuity boundary. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

Unfortunately, this formulation cannot model the infinite compliance of the broken elements accurately, and no simple criterion can be defined to determine the loading-unloading change of state at the integration points of the cohesive elements. Therefore, a modified Lagrangian formulation using a fictitious cohesive traction instead of the classical cohesive traction as the field variable is proposed. Thanks to this change of variable, the cohesive law becomes an increasing function of the equivalent displacement jump, which eliminates the problems mentioned previously. The ability of the proposed formulations to simulate fracture accurately and without field oscillations is investigated through three numerical test examples. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.},

   abstract = {The purpose of this article is to present a general framework for constitutive viscoelastic models in finite strain regime. The approach is qualified as variational since the constitutive updates obey a minimum principle within each load increment. The set of internal variables is strain-based and employs, according to the specific model chosen, a multiplicative decomposition of strain into elastic and viscous components. The present approach shares the same technical procedures used for analogous models of plasticity or viscoplasticity, such as the solution of a minimization problem to identify inelastic updates and the use of exponential mapping for time integration. However, instead of using the classical decomposition of inelastic strains into amplitude and direction, we take advantage of a spectral decomposition that provides additional facilities to accommodate, into simple analytical expressions, a wide set of specific models. Moreover, appropriate choices of the constitutive potentials allow the reproduction of other formulations in the literature. The final part of the paper presents a set of numerical examples in order to explore the characteristics of the formulation as well as its applicability to usual large-scale FEM analyses.

Among them, the ability of reproducing the highly nonlinear rate-dependent stress response and the post-yield strain softening phenomenon. The simplicity of the proposition allows to recover the same mathematical structure of classical constitutive approaches, well suited for the use of implicit finite element codes. To this aim, the flow resistance concept, elsewhere known as shear strength, is reframed as a state variable of an accumulated strain measure. Three alternative expressions for this function are presented. The model is cast within a variational framework in which consistent constitutive updates are obtained by a minimization procedure. Convenient choices for the conservative and dissipative potentials reduce the local constitutive problem to the solution of a single nonlinear scalar equation, emulating the simplest case of viscoelastic models. Numerical tests on the constitutive model show excellent agreement with experimental data. Finally, a 3D simulation of a standard specimen with heterogeneous material properties illustrates the ability of the present proposition to be implemented in implicit finite element codes.},

This, in turn, confers the incremental boundary value problem a variational structure. In particular, the incremental deformation mapping follows from a minimum principle. This minimum principle may conveniently be taken as a basis for error estimation and mesh adaption.

To retrieve a well-posed problem, the material state is described through the gradients of damage in addition to the strain and the damage. Under some assumptions, it is shown that these gradient laws can be cast into a variational formulation. Its numerical treatment is reduced to the design of a mixed finite element so that algorithms such as Newton's method and path-following techniques are still available. Possible convergence difficulties related to the reduction of the damage band width and the appearance of micro instabilities are removed thanks to the design of a new class of brittle laws. Finally, numerical applications show the convergence with mesh refinement, the compatibility with coarser approaches such as Griffith's theory and cohesive crack models, the robustness in case of unstable multi-cracking, the applicability to full-scale 3D situations and the physical relevance compared to experimental data. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

   abstract = {Constitute equations for finite deformation, isotropic, elastic-viscoplastic solids are formulated. The concept of a multiplicative decomposition of the deformation gradient into an elastic and a plastic part is used. The constitutive equation for stress is a hyperelastic relation in terms of the logarithmic elastic strain. Since the material is assumed to be isotropic in every local configuration determined by the plastic part of deformation gradient, the internal variables are necessarily scalars. We use a single scalar as an internal variable to represent the isotropic resistance to plastic flow offered by the internal state of the material. The constitutive equation for stress is often expressed in a rate form, and for metals it is common to approximate this rate equation, under the assumption of infinitesimal elastic strains, to arrive at a hypoelastic equation for the stress. Here, we do not express the stress constitutive equation in a rate form, nor do we make this approximative assumption. For the total form of the stress equation we present a new implicit procedure for updating the stress and other relevant variables. Also, the principle of virtual work is linearized to obtain a consistent, closed-from elasto-viscoplastic tangent operator (the 'Jacobian') for use in solving for global balance of linear momentum in implicit, two-point, deformation driven finite element algorithms. The time integration algorithm is implemented in the finite element program ABAQUS. To check the accuracy and stability of the algorithm, some representative problems involving large, pure elastic and combined elastic-plastic deformations are solved. © 1990.},

Rate-dependent plasticity, heat conduction and thermal coupling are also accounted for in calculations. The properties and predictive ability of the model are exhibited in two case studies: spall tests and dynamic crack propagation in a double cantilever beam specimen.

Their applicability is however often limited by their tendency to fracture in ways that are cannot be predicted by conventional elastic fracture mechanics. Our understanding of fracture in this class of solid has particularly been hindered by the incapacity of determining the competition viscous flow and fracture under finite strains. To tackle this problem, this paper presents a framework that quantitatively captures the interplay between energy dissipation and crack propagation in soft solids made of a single transient network. Using a combined analytical and numerical study, we investigate the dynamics of crack propagation at various loading rates and for networks that display different sensitivities to force. Our results point out to four different crack characteristic behaviors, for which we unveiled the respective mechanisms, all involving a strong interplay between chain deformation, bond dynamics and rupture.},

   abstract = {A novel viscous dissipation potential is proposed for the visco-hyperelastic constitutive modeling of short-time memory responses of soft materials, which can capture both linear and nonlinear large deformation behaviors over a wide range of strain rates. The proposed potential is compatible with objectivity and continuum thermodynamics principles, consists of physically motivated model parameters, and adds the capability of modeling strain rate sensitivity in the small strain regime, which is currently not possible with available external state variable driven viscous dissipation potentials. By combining the proposed viscous dissipation potential with the Mooney-Rivlin strain energy density function, a visco-hyperelastic relation is formulated and fit to the rate-dependent tensile stress-strain data of human patellar tendon, which was previously modeled using an existing viscous dissipation potential. It is demonstrated that the proposed model offers improvements in fitting accuracy and prevents possible thermodynamic instabilities in quasi-static hyperelastic models from corrupting the dynamic response. In addition, the uncomplicated mathematical form of the model and the accompanying multi-step multi-start optimization procedure helps prevent numerical instabilities. Multi-deformation mode fitting of human brain gray matter under all three primary deformation modes (compression, tension and shear) is also considered using a visco-hyperelastic model based on the proposed potential and the semi-empirical Gent-Gent strain energy density function. It is shown that visco-hyperelastic models based on the proposed viscous dissipation potential capture all the essential features of the stress-strain data with unique optimal model parameters, giving reasonable accuracy in both single and multiple deformation mode cases. Further, it is demonstrated that the proposed model is stable and robust with respect to both the choice of the hyperelastic strain energy density and the availability of data from multiple deformation modes.},

In addition to the conventional balances for mass, linear momentum and energy these equations include also a counterpart of the Gibbs-Thomson equation familiar from theories for crystal growth. This additional equation arises from a consideration of configurational forces within a thermodynamical framework. Although the notion of configurational forces is well-developed and understood for the description of materials, such as crystalline solids, that possess natural reference configurations, little has been done regarding their role in materials, such as viscous fluids, that do not possess preferred reference states. We therefore provide a comprehensive discussion of configurational forces, the balance of configurational momentum, and configurational thermodynamics that does not require a choice of reference configuration. The general evolution equations arising from our theory account for the thermodynamic structure of the bulk phases and the interface and for viscous and thermal dissipation in the bulk phases and for viscous dissipation on the interface. Because of the complexity of these equations, we provide a reduced system of equations based on simplified constitutive assumptions and approximations common in the literature on phase transformations. Using these reduced equations, we apply the theory to the radially symmetric problem for the condensation of a liquid drop into the vapour phase. © 2007 Cambridge University Press.},

   abstract = {Continuous models of material degradation may cease to produced meaningful results in the presence of high strain gradients. These gradients may occur for instance in the propagation of waves with high wave numbers and at stress concentrators. Adding nonlocal or gradient terms to the constitutive modelling may enhance the ability of the models to describe such situations. The effect of adding nonlocal or gradient terms and the relation between these enhancements are examined in a continuum damage setting. A nonlocal damage model and two different gradient damage models are considered. In one of the gradient models higher order deformation gradients enter the equilibrium equations explicity, while in the other model the gradient influence follows in a more implicit way from an additional partial differential equation. The latter, implicit gradient formulation can be rewritten in the integral format of the nonlocal model and can therefore be regarded as truly nonlocal. This is not true for the explicit formulation, in which the nonlocality is limited to an infinitesimal volume. This fundamental difference between the formulations results in quite different behaviour in wave propagation, localisation and at crack tips. This is shown for the propagation of waves in the models, their localisation properties and the behaviour at a crack tip. The responses of the nonlocal model and the implicit gradient model agree remarkably well in these situations, while the explicit gradient formulation shows an entirely different and sometimes nonphysical response. © 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Whereas gradient-enhanced damage models find their roots in damage mechanics, which is a smeared approach from the onset, and gradients were added to restore well-posedness beyond a critical strain level, the phase-field approach to brittle fracture departs from a discontinuous description of failure, where the distribution function is regularised, leading to the inclusion of spatial gradients as well. Herein, we will consider both approaches, and discuss their similarities and differences. The averaging (diffusion) equations for the averaging field and the phase-field will be compared, and it is shown that the diffusion equation for the phase-field can be conceived as a special case of the averaging equation of a gradient-damage model where the damage is averaged. Further, the role of the driving force is examined, and it is shown that subtle differences in the degradation functions commonly adopted in damage and phase-field approaches are key to the observation that, different from damage mechanics, the fracture process zone does not broaden in the wake of the crack tip.},

Eighteen three-point-bend tests were conducted using either a servo-hydraulic machine or a self-designed drop-weight impact device. Four strain gauges mounted along the ligament of the specimen were used to measure the crack velocity. Six different loading rates were applied, from 10-4 mm/s to 103 mm/s (average strain rate from 10-6 to 10-1 s-1), i.e., a low loading-rate range (5.50 × 10-4 mm/s, 0.55 mm/s and 17.4 mm/s) and a high loading-rate range (8.81 × 102 mm/s, 1.76 × 103 mm/s and 2.64 × 103 mm/s). At low loading rates, the crack propagates with increasing velocity. Under high loading rates, the crack propagates with slightly decreasing velocity, though the maximum crack speed reached up to 20.6% of the Rayleigh wave speed of the tested HSC. In addition, the loading-rate effect on crack velocities is pronounced within the low loading-rate regime, whereas it is minor under the high loading-rate range. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

A new situation arose with the technique of casting low-modulus rubber with an optically smooth surface. When placed in contact with each other, or with a smooth hard surface like plate glass, such specimens are sufficiently compliant to make intimate contact throughout the whole of their apparent contact area. High adhesion is then observed; in fact the measured force required to separate the surfaces is generally greatly in excess of that which would be expected from the action of surface forces alone. The measured force of adhesion is found to depend on the rate of separation and to correlate with the viscoelastic properties of the rubber. The present state of knowledge of this phenomenon is reviewed and the mechanics of the process whereby the viscoelastic properties of the solids amplify their true surface energy is explained. © 1981 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

When the material behaviour is elastic with damage, an analytical solution is produced which gives the size of the localisation as a function of the step load.

   abstract = {A continuous damage theory is presented for the quasi-static and dynamic behavior of brittle materials. The fact that the strain-rate effects observed can be mainly attributed to the rate-sensitivity of the microcracking process makes the damage concept particularly attractive. Considering flat microcracks a vectorial representation is adopted for the damage variable. A free energy function dependent on the coupled invariants of strain and damage is postulated, and the constitutive equations and the damage evolution equations are derived consistently subject to thermodynamic restrictions. The stress-strain curves for uniaxial tension and compression resulting from the theory are compared with available experimental results for concrete. A decrease in the nonlinearity of the stress-strain curves is observed as the strain-rate is increased. A higher strain-rate sensitivity in tension, as compared to compression, is also predicted. Further results on uniaxial tension illustrate how pre-existing damage influences the nonlinearity of the stress-strain curves and results in a rotation of the damage vector. © ASCE.},

   abstract = {This work presents a generalization of recently developed continuum phase field models for brittle fracture towards fully coupled thermo-mechanical and multi-physics problems at large strains. It outlines a rigorous geometric approach to the diffusive crack modeling based on the introduction of a balance of regularized crack surface, governed by a crack phase field. The regularized crack surface functional is based on a crack surface density function, that describes the macroscopic crack surface in the bulk material per unit of the reference volume. The approach overcomes difficulties associated with the computational realization of sharp crack discontinuities, in particular when it comes to complex crack topologies. The formulation proposed is essentially a gradient damage theory, however, equipped with critical ingredients rooted in fracture mechanics. A modular concept is outlined for the linking of the diffusive crack modeling with complex multi-field response of the bulk material, where focus is put on the model problem of finite thermo-elasticity. This concerns a generalization of crack driving forces from the energetic definitions towards stress-based criteria, the constitutive modeling of heat conduction across cracks and convective heat exchanges at crack faces based on additional constitutive functions. This is achieved by approximating surface load integrals of the sharp crack approach by distinct volume integrals. We demonstrate the performance of the phase field formulation of fracture at large strains by means of representative numerical examples.},

   abstract = {The velocity transition in crack-growth dynamics and the accompanying changes in crack tip shapes are investigated for the elastomers composed of styrene-butadiene rubber and silica filler (SBR/SI). The concentrations of filler and cross-link (ϕf and cx, respectively), and temperature (T) are extensively varied in order to change the degree of nonlinearity in elasticity of the elastomers. The shapes of the crack tip are characterized by three parameters, i.e., the deviation δ from the parabolic one expected by the linear elastic fracture mechanics (LEFM), the parabolic curvature a, and the non-dimensional quantity aδ. The dependence of these parameters on the input tearing energy Γ is successfully explained by the weakly nonlinear theory of dynamic fracture (WNLT), which considers the contribution of the second-order shear modulus μ(2) to the strain field in addition to that of the first-order shear modulus μ(1), independently of ϕf, cx and T, unless δ exceeds a limit value (δC). SBR/SI shows an appreciably larger value of δC than the carbon-black filled acrylonitrile butadiene (NBR/CB) elastomers. The smaller value of δC for NBR/CB is attributed to that the contribution of the third-order nonlinear modulus μ(3)/μ(1), which is not considered in WNLT, is appreciably higher than that in SBR/SI. The magnitude of the threshold tearing energy Γc for the onset of the velocity transition shows a good correlation with the fracture toughness Wc normalized by the nonlinear elastic constant μ(1)3/μ(2)2 in WNLT. This result indicates that the magnitude is governed by the combined effect of the degree of nonlinearity in elasticity and the fracture toughness.},

   abstract = {Crack growth rates (r) were measured in pure shear test specimens as a function of strain energy release rate (G) for a non-crystallizing SBR elastomer. Measurements were made as a function of: extent of swelling with Dibutyl Adipate; carbon black content; and crosslink density. In some cases experiments were carried out over a range of temperatures. In most cases the resulting G versus r plots showed a clear transition from rough to smooth crack surface behaviour with increasing crack growth rate, with an intervening slip/stick region. In the high speed/steady tear/smooth region the value of G necessary to drive a crack at a given rate was determined largely by the magnitude of the visco-elastic losses in the crack tip region, increasing with: decreasing temperature; increasing molar mass between crosslinks; decreasing extent of swelling; and increasing carbon black content. However G was independent of specimen thickness in this region suggesting that crack tip effects were minimal. In the low speed/rough region changes in the magnitude of G with materials and temperature/rate variables could not be explained by changes in visco-elastic loss alone. Furthermore the magnitude of G increased significantly with increasing specimen thickness. This suggested that in this region cavitation ahead of the growing crack tip resulting from dilatational stresses determined the crack tip diameter, and hence the magnitude of G. © 2000 Kluwer Academic Publishers.},

A number of extensions from brittle to ductile materials have been proposed and results are promising. To date, however, these extensions have not accurately represented strains after crack initiation or included important aspects of ductile fracture such as stress triaxiality. This work introduces a number of contributions to further develop phase-field models for fracture in ductile materials. These contributions include: a cubic degradation function that provides a stress–strain response prior to crack initiation that more closely approximates linear elastic behavior, a derivation of the governing equations in terms of a general energy potential from balance laws that describe the kinematics of both the body and phase-field, introduction of a yield surface degradation function that provides a mechanism for plastic softening and corrects the non-physical elastic deformations after crack initiation, a proposed mechanism for including a measure of stress triaxiality as a driving force for crack initiation and propagation, and a correction to an error in the configuration update of an elastoplastic return-mapping algorithm for J2 flow theory. We also present a heuristic time stepping scheme that facilitates computations that require a relatively long load time prior to crack initiation.

Stress and displacement components are given a spectral representation as finite Fourier series in space coordinates parallel to the fracture plane. The formulation is based on an exact representation, involving a convolution integral for each Fourier mode, of the elastodynamic relation existing between the time-dependent Fourier coefficients for the tractions acting on the fracture plane and for the resulting displacement discontinuities. A wide range of constitutive models can be used to relate the local value of the strength on the fracture plane with the displacement and velocity history. Efficiency of the code is achieved by using an explicit time integration scheme and by computing the conversion between the spatial and spectral distributions through a FFT algorithm. The method is particularly suited to implementation on massively parallel computers; a CM-5 was used in this work. The stability and precision of the formulation are discussed for tensile (mode 1) situations in a detailed modal analysis, and numerical results are compared with existing three-dimensional elastodynamic solutions. The adequacy of the method to investigate various three-dimensional dynamic fracture problems involving non-propagating and propagating tensile cracks is illustrated, including crack growth along a plane of heterogeneous fracture toughness. © 1995.},

The rate at which energy is absorbed by the running crack can then be calculated in terms of the crack motion and the scalar stress intensity factors. The fact that this rate of energy absorption is positive for any running crack plays a central role in the subsequent proof of the uniqueness theorem.

The model proposed is based on the multiplicative decomposition of the isochoric component of deformation gradient into elastic and viscous contribution and the generalized Maxwell rheological model. The inelastic or viscous components of the deformation gradient provide the internal variables required for the irreversible thermo-mechanical model. Nonlinear rate type of evolution equations are then proposed for the internal variables. These are based on a particular linear relaxation form of the generalized Maxwell model which leads to a viscoelastic formulation that can be seen as a particular case of a large strain viscoplastic model based on maximum plastic dissipation. In addition to the rate evolution equations, simple incremental stress update equations are proposed. These closely resemble the radial return algorithms used in von Mises plasticity. Finally a spatial form of the viscoelastic formulation is presented for isotropic materials. This formulation is based on principal directions and logarithmic stretches. Again incremental equations will be considered in order to permit subsequent computational implementations. © 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Fragmentation processes involve large strain rates and short time scales that take place during crack nucleation and propagation. Using rubber membranes, we develop an experimental analysis that enables us to track the fragmentation process in situ in both time and space. We find that bursting a highly stretched membrane yields a treelike fragmentation network that originates at a single seed crack, followed by successive crack tip-splitting events. We show that a dynamic instability drives this branching mechanism. Fragmentation occurs when the crack tip speed attains a critical velocity for which tip splitting becomes the sole available mechanism of releasing the stored elastic energy. Given the general character of the fragmentation processes, this framework should be applicable to other crack networks in brittle materials.},

   abstract = {Continuum approaches to fracture regard crack initiation and growth as the ultimate consequences of a gradual, local loss of material integrity. The material models which are traditionally used to describe the degradation process, however, may predict premature crack initiation and instantaneous, perfectly brittle crack growth. This nonphysical response is caused by localisation instabilities due to loss of ellipticity of the governing equations and - more importantly - singularity of the damage rate at the crack tip. It is argued that this singularity results in instantaneous failure in a vanishing volume, even if ellipticity is not first lost. Adding strong nonlocality to the modelling is shown to preclude localisation instabilities and remove damage rate singularities. As a result, premature crack initiation is avoided and crack growth rates remain finite. Weak nonlocality, as provided by explicit gradient models, does not suffice for this purpose. In implementing the enhanced modelling, the crack must be excluded from the equilibrium problem and the nonlocal interactions in order to avoid unrealistic damage growth. © 2002 Éditions scientifiques et médicales Elsevier SAS.

   abstract = {A compressive shear test for investigating adhesion between an elastomeric polymer and a rigid substrate has been studied. The test consists of loading a specimen comprising of a 3-ply laminate: substrate/polymer/substrate, in compression and shear at a specified angle to the loading direction. Under displacement control and when adhesion is sufficiently low, an interfacial crack nucleates at one interface early during loading and propagates stably up to a critical load at which unstable propagation with an associated load drop ensues. The case of an isothennal hyperelastic material has been analyzed by computing the energy release rate for an interfacial crack as a function of crack length. The analysis shows that for a range of initial crack size interfacial crack propagation is stable until crack length reaches a critical size at which unstable propagation ensues. The energy release rate at this instability is relatively insensitive to angle of loading, strain, and hyperelastic parameters, which allows one to extract an interfacial toughness, Γ0, from overall measurement of stress and strain. The analysis has been extended to consider combined hyperelasticity and viscoelasticity by using a cohesive zone model for crack propagation implemented as a cohesive finite element. The energy release rate and cohesive zone analyses give identical results for an hyperelastic material. For a viscoelastic-hyperelastic material, the cohesive zone approach allows the viscous losses in the bulk polymer to be estimated separately from the value of interfacial fracture toughness. Both analyses have been applied to experiments on glass/polyvinyl butyral (Butacite®)/glass laminate specimens. The 'intrinsic' interfacial toughness, consisting of contributions from bond rupture and a near-tip process zone, is found to be rate-dependent and lies in the range 50-200 J m-2.},

The models are developed in the form of weak discontinuous solutions of the equations of motion for isotropic linear elasticity in two dimensions. Instead of the classical second order elastodynamics equations in terms of the displacement field, equivalent first order equations in terms of the evolution of velocity and displacement gradient fields are used together with their associated jump conditions across solution discontinuities. The paper postulates supersonic and intersonic steady-state crack propagation solutions consisting of regions of constant deformation and velocity separated by pressure and shear shock waves converging at the crack tip and obtains the necessary requirements for their existence. It shows that such mathematical solutions exist for significant ranges of material properties both in plane stress and plane strain. Both mode I and mode II fracture configurations are considered. In line with the linear elasticity theory used, the solutions obtained satisfy exact energy conservation, which implies that strain energy in the unfractured material is converted in its entirety into kinetic energy as the crack propagates. This neglects dissipation phenomena both in the material and in the creation of the new crack surface. This leads to the conclusion that fast crack propagation beyond the classical limit of the Rayleigh wave speed is a phenomenon dominated by the transfer of strain energy into kinetic energy rather than by the transfer into surface energy, which is the basis of Griffiths theory.},

In the damaged zone, the damage variable is an explicit function of the level set. This function is a parameter of the model. Beyond a critical length, we assume the material to be totally damaged, thus allowing a straightforward transition to fracture. The damage growth is expressed as a level set propagation. The configurational force driving the damage front is non-local in the sense that it averages information over the thickness in the wake of the front. The computational and theoretical advantages of the new damage model are stressed. Numerical examples demonstrate the capability of the new model to initiate cracks and propagate them even in complex topological patterns (branching and merging for instance).

   abstract = {A fracture theory for a heterogenous aggregate material which exhibits a gradual strain-softening due to microcracking and contains aggregate pieces that are not necessarily small compared to structural dimensions is developed. Only Mode I is considered. The fracture is modeled as a blunt smeard crack band, which is justified by the random nature of the microstructure. Simple triaxial stress-strain relations which model the strain-softening and describe the effect of gradual microcracking in the crack band are derived. It is shown that it is easier to use compliance rather than stiffness matrices and that it suffices to adjust a single diagonal term of the complicance matrix. The limiting case of this matrix for complete (continuous) cracking is shown to be identical to the inverse of the well-known stiffness matrix for a perfectly cracked material. The material fracture properties are characterized by only three parameters—fracture energy, uniaxial strength limit and width of the crack band (fracture process zone), while the strain-softening modulus is a function of these parameters. A method of determining the fracture energy from measured complete stres-strain relations is also given. Triaxial stress effects on fracture can be taken into account. The theory is verified by comparisons with numerous experimental data from the literature. Satisfactory fits of maximum load data as well as resistance curves are achieved and values of the three material parameters involved, namely the fracture energy, the strength, and the width of crack band front, are determined from test data. The optimum value of the latter width is found to be about 3 aggregate sizes, which is also justified as the minimum acceptable for a homogeneous continuum modeling. The method of implementing the theory in a finite element code is also indicated, and rules for achieving objectivity of results with regard to the analyst's choice of element size are given. Finally, a simple formula is derived to predict from the tensile strength and aggregate size the fracture energy, as well as the strain-softening modulus. A statistical analysis of the errors reveals a drastic improvement compared to the linear fracture theory as well as the strength theory. The applicability of fracture mechanics to concrete is thus solidly established.},

Appropriate integration path choices serve both to relate the integral to the near tip deformations and, in many cases, to permit its direct evaluation. This averaged measure of the near tip field leads to approximate solutions for several strain-concentration problems. Contained perfectly plastic deformation near a crack tip is analyzed for the plane-strain case with the aid of the slip-line theory. Near tip stresses are shown to be significantly elevated by hydrostatic tension, and a strain singularity results varying inversely with distance from the tip in centered fan regions above and below the tip. Approximate estimates are given for the strain intensity, plastic zone size, and crack tip opening displacement, and the important role of large geometry changes in crack blunting is noted. Another application leads to a general solution for crack tip separations in the Barenblatt-Dugdale crack model. A proof follows on the equivalence of the Griffith energy balance and cohesive force theories of elastic brittle fracture, and hardening behavior is included in a model for plane-stress yielding. A final application leads to approximate estimates of strain concentrations at smooth-ended notch tips in elastic and elastic-plastic materials.},

   abstract = {Publisher Summary The chapter presents a discussion on the continuum theory of lattice defects. The continuum analog of a crystal containing imperfections is an elastic body in a state of stress not produced by surface and body forces. The appropriate tool for handling the “continuum theory of lattice defects” is thus the usual theory of elasticity modified to include internal stress. Unlike the residual stresses encountered in engineering practice, these internal stresses have to be considered as capable of moving about in the medium. Recent interest in solid state physics has stimulated further development. The discussion of this chapter emphasizes on some of the background principles and illustrates them by specific examples chosen to bring out the peculiar features involved. Naturally, the continuum theory can hardly be expected to answer questions of current interest about the more intimate behavior of lattice defects (for example, the binding energy of two adjacent point defects). On the other hand, the theory perhaps suffers from the disadvantage that its limitations are more immediately obvious than are those of other approximate methods that have to be used in dealing with the solid state, for it sometimes gives good results even in what appear to be extreme cases. The theory of elasticity is concerned with the relation between the deformation of a body and the energy content of itself and its surroundings. The chapter also discusses specification of internal stress, including the Somigliana dislocations and the incompatibility tensor.},

Comparison with exact solutions for circular arc cracks and straight cracks with kinks indicates that the first order solution is numerically accurate for considerable deviations from straightness. The solution is applied to fromulate an equation for the path of crack growth, on the assumption that the path is characterized by pure Mode I conditions (i.e., KII=0) at the advancing tip. This method confirms the dependence of the stability, under Mode I loading, of a straight crack path on the sign of the non-singular stress term, representing tensile stress T acting parallel to the crack, in the Irwin-Williams expansion of the crack tip field. The straight path is shown to be stable under Mode I loading for T<0 and unstable for T>0.},

Crack initiation and subsequent propagation—the dynamic process of fracture—couples a wide range of time and length scales. Crack dynamics challenge our understanding of the fundamental physics processes that take place in the extreme conditions within the almost singular region where material failure occurs. Here, we first briefly review the classic approach to dynamic fracture, namely linear elastic fracture mechanics (LEFM), and discuss its successes and limitations. We show how, on the one hand, recent experiments performed on straight cracks propagating in soft brittle materials have quantitatively confirmed the predictions of this theory to an unprecedented degree. On the other hand, these experiments show how LEFM breaks down as the singular region at the tip of a crack is approached. This breakdown naturally leads to a new theoretical framework coined ‘weakly nonlinear fracture mechanics’, where weak elastic nonlinearities are incorporated. The stronger singularity predicted by this theory gives rise to a new and intrinsic length scale, ℓnl. These predictions are verified in detail through direct measurements. We then theoretically and experimentally review how the emergence of ℓnl is linked to a new equation for crack motion, which predicts the existence of a high-speed oscillatory crack instability whose wavelength is determined by ℓnl. We conclude by delineating outstanding challenges in the field.},

Both conditions allow to precisely control the crack propagation speed and to test the predictions of existing theories. By employing the new set-up we measure the energy release rate as a function of the crack propagation speed. We also measure with a high precision infrared camera the increase of temperature at the crack tip, showing that, notwithstanding the low speed regime considered during the experiments, the viscoelastic dissipation at the crack tip leads to a measurable temperature increase of about 1°C.},

   abstract = {A theory of crack propagation, resulting from the application of a monotonic increasing applied stress, in a linear viscoelastic material, is derived based upon an energy balance fracture criterion. It is shown that for a Maxwell solid the crack growth law can be derived either from a global energy balance taking full account of the energy dissipation resulting from viscoelastic flow, or from a local energy balance taking account of the dissipation in the failure zones. The local energy balance method allows the derivation of the crack growth law for more general linear viscoelastic solids. The theory predicts the well known Griffith condition for fracture when the material is simply linear elastic. For a crack having failure zones in a linear viscoelastic solid the growth law for a constant applied stress is where c(t) is the time dependent half-crack length, 641-1 is the yield or crazing stress in the failure zone, K(t) is the time dependent stress intensity factor, Γ is the fracture energy, ν is Poisson's ratio and J(t) is the uniaxial creep function of the viscoelastic material.

The evolution problem is formulated following a variational approach based on the principles of irreversibility, stability and energy balance. Applied to a monotonically increasing traction test of a one-dimensional bar, we consider the homogeneous response where both the strain and the damage fields are uniform in space. In the case of a softening behavior, we show that the homogeneous state of the bar at a given time is stable provided that the length of the bar is less than a state dependent critical value and unstable otherwise. However, we also show that bifurcations can appear even if the homogeneous state is stable. All these results are obtained in a closed form. Finally, we propose a practical method to identify the two constitutive functions. This method is based on the measure of the homogeneous response in a situation where this response is stable without possibility of bifurcation, and on a procedure which gives the opportunity to detect its loss of stability.

In this article, we first formulate the quasi-static evolution problem for a general class of such damage models. Then, we introduce a stability criterion in terms of the positivity of the second derivative of the total energy under the unilateral constraint induced by the irreversibility of damage. These concepts are applied in the particular setting of a one-dimensional traction test. We construct homogeneous as well as localized damage solutions in a closed form and illustrate the concepts of loss of stability, of scale effects, of damage localization, and of structural failure. Considering several specific constitutive models, stress-displacement curves, stability diagrams, and energy dissipation provide identification criteria for the relevant material parameters, such as limit stress and internal length.

   abstract = {In this paper we formulate a geometric theory of the mechanics of growing solids. Bulk growth is modeled by a material manifold with an evolving metric. The time dependence of the metric represents the evolution of the stress-free (natural) configuration of the body in response to changes in mass density and "shape". We show that the time dependency of the material metric will affect the energy balance and the entropy production inequality; both the energy balance and the entropy production inequality have to be modified. We then obtain the governing equations covariantly by postulating invariance of energy balance under time-dependent spatial diffeomorphisms. We use the principle of maximum entropy production in deriving an evolution equation for the material metric. In the case of isotropic growth, we find those growth distributions that do not result in residual stresses. We then look at Lagrangian field theory of growing elastic solids. We will use the Lagrange-d'Alembert principle with Rayleigh's dissipation functions to derive the governing equations. We make an explicit connection between our geometric theory and the conventional multiplicative decomposition of the deformation gradient, F=F e F g, into growth and elastic parts. We linearize the nonlinear theory and derive a linearized theory of growth mechanics. Finally, we obtain the stress-free growth distributions in the linearized theory. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

   abstract = {Investigation of dynamic fracture of elastomers can still be considered to be a relatively open area. When a sheet of elastomer is stretched in a tensile machine and a crack is introduced, the crack propagates at a speed that depends on the initial stretch level. There are instances where this speed is noted to exceed the shear wave speed based on the elastic modulus under high imposed stretches. Such cracks are called transonic cracks. It was usually hypothesized that either the hyperelastic or viscoelastic stiffening of the bulk material raises the wave speeds resulting in crack speeds entering the transonic regime. This article revisits the experiments performed on Polyurethane elastomers in Corre et al. (Int J Fract 224(1):83–100, 2020) to study the implications of both these hypotheses. Crack propagation has not been explicitly modeled, but the crack speeds are implicitly imposed on the geometry using the boundary conditions extracted from the experimental data. It has been determined that the viscoelasticity in the bulk is needed to describe and understand the transonic cracks in polyurethane elastomer. The inclusion of viscoelasticity results in the notions of ‘rubbery’ and ‘glassy’ wave speeds and hence, the transonic regime is defined considering the rubbery wave speed.},

   abstract = {A geometric nonlinear and thermodynamical consistent constitutive theory is proposed, which allows the representation of the thermomechanical behaviour of carbon black filled rubber. In a recent paper [1] it was shown that the mechanical behaviour of this material is mainly influenced by nonlinear elasticity coupled with some inelastic effects, in particular the Mullins-effect, nonlinear rate dependence and a weak equilibrium hysteresis. In the present paper, the Mullins-effect is not taken into consideration. At first we discuss a uniaxial approach, based on a simple spring dashpot system of viscoplasticity. The essential feature of this model is a decomposition of the total stress into a rate independent equilibrium stress and a nonlinear rate dependent overstress. The equilibrium stress is decomposed into a sum of two terms as well: The first term, the elastic part of the equilibrium stress, is a nonlinear function of the total strain, and the second term, the so-called hysteretic part, depends in a rate independent manner on the strain history. Both the overstress and the hysteretic part of the equilibrium stress are determined by nonlinear elasticity relations which depend on internal variables. These internal variables are inelastic strains, and the corresponding evolution equations are developed in consideration of the second law of thermodynamics. Accordingly, we demonstrate that the principle of non-negative dissipation is satisfied for arbitrary deformation processes. In a further step, we transfer the structure of this model to the three-dimensional and geometric nonlinear case. In a certain sense similar to finite deformation elasto-plasticity, we introduce two multiplicative decompositions of the deformation gradient into elastic and inelastic parts. The first decomposition is defined with respect to the overstress and the second one with respect to the hysteretic part of the equilibrium stress. Consequently, two intermediate configurations are induced, which lead two different decompositions of the Green's strain tensor into elastic and inelastic parts. The latter are the internal variables of the model. For physical reasons, we define the corresponding stress tensors and derivatives in the sense of the concept of dual variables [7], [39]. The constitutive equations for the overstress and for the hysteretic part of the equilibrium stress are specified by nonlinear elasticity relations, formulated with respect to the different intermediate configurations. In order to facilitate a separate description of inelastic bulk and distortional effects, we introduce kinematic decompositions of the deformation gradient into volumetric and distortional parts. Numerical simulations demonstrate that the developed theory represents the mechanical behaviour of a tread compound at room temperature very well. Thermomechanical heating effects, which are caused by inelastic deformations are also described by the theory. The method proposed in this paper can be utilised to generalise uniaxial rheological models to three-dimensional finite strain theories, which are admissible in the sense of the second law of thermodynamics.},

For purposes of analysis, the basis is refined and/or its order elevated without changing the geometry or its parameterization. Analogues of finite element h- and p-refinement schemes are presented and a new, more efficient, higher-order concept, k-refinement, is introduced. Refinements are easily implemented and exact geometry is maintained at all levels without the necessity of subsequent communication with a CAD (Computer Aided Design) description. In the context of structural mechanics, it is established that the basis functions are complete with respect to affine transformations, meaning that all rigid body motions and constant strain states are exactly represented. Standard patch tests are likewise satisfied. Numerical examples exhibit optimal rates of convergence for linear elasticity problems and convergence to thin elastic shell solutions. A k-refinement strategy is shown to converge toward monotone solutions for advection-diffusion processes with sharp internal and boundary layers, a very surprising result. It is argued that isogeometric analysis is a viable alternative to standard, polynomial-based, finite element analysis and possesses several advantages. © 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {The time‐dependent behavior of linearly viscoelastic materials is known to be very sensitive to changes in temperature and in solvent (water) concentration. Following an investigation by the authors of this sensitivity in terms of the associated small volume changes, a nonlinearly viscoelastic model of constitutive behavior was formulated earlier in terms of the free volume concept and evaluated in terms of experiments on poly(vinyl acetate). Following a brief presentation of the earlier results these concepts are expanded and refined in the present paper to deal with transient deformation histories under pressure. In this connection, model computations explore the effect of simultaneous pressurization and straining. In addition the effect of “ageing” the polymer under pressures of various magnitudes and for different lengths of time are investigated. It becomes clear that the yield phenomenon depends sensitively on pressure and on the ageing time. In addition, the volume change under transient thermal histories in the glass transition range is explored, largely in terms of Kovacs' experimental data and attendant computations. These considerations are presented from a unified point of view of nonlinear thermoviscoelastic constitutive behavior, principally with phenomenological material description in mind. These computations provide guidance to the design of experiments for the proper determination of the relevant material functions and seem to indicate a need for the reevaluation of certain experimental procedures in the time histories of thermal material characterization.

The key computational implication is this: the closest-point-projection algorithm of any classical simple-surface or multi-surface model of infinitesimal plasticity carries over to the present finite deformation context without modification. In particular, the algorithmic elastoplastic tangent moduli of the infinitesimal theory remain unchanged. For the static problem, the proposed class of algorithms preserve exactly plastic volume changes if the yield criterion is pressure insensitive. For the dynamic problem, a class of time-stepping algorithms is presented which inherits exactly the conservation laws of total linear and angular momentum.

In this paper we study the physical interpretation of the components of the logarithmic strain tensor in any arbitrary system of representation, which is crucial in formulating meaningful constitutive models. We use the path-independence property of total logarithmic strains to propose different fictitious paths which can be interpreted as a sum of infinitesimal engineering strain tensors. We show that the angular (engineering) distortion measure is arguably not a good measure of shear and instead we propose area distortions which are an exact interpretation of the shear terms both for engineering and for logarithmic strains.

Data-driven solvers seek to assign to each material point the state from a prespecified data set that is closest to satisfying the conservation laws. Equivalently, data-driven solvers aim to find the state satisfying the conservation laws that is closest to the data set. The resulting data-driven problem thus consists of the minimization of a distance function to the data set in phase space subject to constraints introduced by the conservation laws. We motivate the data-driven paradigm and investigate the performance of data-driven solvers by means of two examples of application, namely, the static equilibrium of nonlinear three-dimensional trusses and linear elasticity. In these tests, the data-driven solvers exhibit good convergence properties both with respect to the number of data points and with regard to local data assignment. The variational structure of the data-driven problem also renders it amenable to analysis. We show that, as the data set approximates increasingly closely a classical material law in phase space, the data-driven solutions converge to the classical solution. We also illustrate the robustness of data-driven solvers with respect to spatial discretization. In particular, we show that the data-driven solutions of finite-element discretizations of linear elasticity converge jointly with respect to mesh size and approximation by the data set.},

These tangent spaces are constructed by means of the tensor voting method introduced by Mordohai and Medioni (2010) which improves the learning of the underlying structure of a data set. Tensor voting is an instance-based machine learning technique which accumulates votes from the nearest neighbors to build up second-order tensors encoding tangents and normals to the underlying data structure. The here proposed second-order data-driven paradigm is a plug-in method for distance-minimizing as well as entropy-maximizing data-driven schemes. Like its predecessor (Kirchdoerfer and Ortiz, 2016), the resulting method aims to minimize a suitably defined free energy over phase space subject to compatibility and equilibrium constraints. The method's implementation is straightforward and numerically efficient since the data structure analysis is performed in an offline step. Selected numerical examples are presented that establish the higher-order convergence properties of the data-driven solvers enhanced by tensor voting for ideal and noisy data sets.},

In this study, we compare and develop several possible data structures for solving the nearest-neighbor problem. We show that approximate nearest-neighbor (ANN) algorithms can accelerate material data searches by several orders of magnitude relative to exact searching algorithms. The approximations are suggested by—and adapted to—the structure of the data-driven iterative solver and result in no significant loss of solution accuracy. We assess the performance of the ANN algorithm with respect to material data set size with the aid of a 3D elasticity test case.

By building on i) accurate mathematical representation of particle morphology and contact interaction, ii) full control of the initial state of the assembly, and iii) discrete element simulation of arbitrary stress paths, the proposed framework overcomes important limitations associated with conventional experiments and simulations. The framework is utilized to investigate the incremental response of sand through stress probing experiments, focusing on key aspects such as elasticity and reversibility, yielding and plastic flow, as well as hardening and fabric evolution. It is shown that reversible strain envelopes are contained within elastic envelopes during axisymmetric loading, the yield locus follows approximately the Lade-Duncan criterion, and the plastic flow rule exhibits complex nonassociativity and minor irregularity. Hardening processes are delineated by examining the stored plastic work and the fabric evolution in the strong and weak networks. Special attention is given to isolating in turn the effect of particle shape and interparticle friction on the macroscopic response. Interestingly, idealization of particle shape preserves qualitatively most aspects of material behavior, but proves quantitatively inadequate especially in anisotropic stress states. The results point to the importance of accurately resolving particle-scale interactions, that allows macroscopic behavior to emerge free from spurious micromechanical artifacts present in an idealized setting.},

The authors follow closely this debate and try, with this paper, to provide a platform where the various viewpoints could find their position. We consider an ensemble of rigid, arbitrarily shaped grains as a set with structure. We establish a basic mathematical framework which allows to express the balance laws and the action-reaction laws for the discrete system in a "global" form, through the concepts of "part", "granular surface", "separately additive function" and "flux". The independent variable in the balance laws is then the arbitrary part of the assembly rather than the single grain. A parallel framework is constructed for Cosserat continua, by applying the axiomatics established by [Noll, W., 1959. The foundation of classical mechanics in the light of recent advances in continuum mechanics.

   abstract = {Purpose: With many policies in Germany steering towards a bioeconomy, there is a need for analytical tools that assess not only the environmental and economic implications but also the social implications of a transition to a bioeconomy. Wood is expected to become a major biomass resource in bioeconomy regions. Therefore, this paper develops a social life cycle assessment (sLCA) framework that can be applied specifically to a wood-based production system in one of Germany’s bioeconomy regions. Methods: This paper reviews and analyses existing sLCA approaches, in terms of how applicable they are for assessing a wood-based production system in a German bioeconomy regional context. The analysis is structured according to the standard phases of environmental life cycle assessment (LCA). However, we use the term social effects rather than social impacts, to acknowledge the unknown cause–effect relationship between an organisation’s activities and its social impacts. We also consider the establishment of regional system boundaries, as well as the relationship between the social effects and the product being assessed. Additionally, an approach for the development and selection of social indicators and indices is outlined. Furthermore, we discuss data requirements and present an approach for a social life cycle impact assessment method. Results and discussion: A new conceptual framework for a context-specific sLCA to assess wood-based products manufactured in a bioeconomy region was developed. It enables sLCA practitioners to identify “social hotspots” and “social opportunities” from a regional perspective. The location and characteristics of these social hotspots and opportunities can be analysed, in particular, for major production activities in a bioeconomy region in Germany. Therefore, according to this framework, the development of social indices and indicators, the collection of data and the approach used for characterising social effects need to relate to the geographical context of the product being assessed. The proposed framework can, thus, help to identify, monitor and evaluate the social sustainability of wood-based bioeconomy chains in a regional context. Conclusions: This framework requires a high level of detail in the social inventory and impact assessment phase, in order to assess the regional foreground activities in a German wood-based bioeconomy region. It enables sLCA studies to identify which social hotspots and social opportunities occur and where they are located in the wood-based production system of a regional bioeconomy.},

   abstract = {This paper presents discrete element method (DEM) simulations with experimental comparisons at multiple length scales—underscoring the crucial role of particle shape. The simulations build on technological advances in the DEM furnished by level sets (LS-DEM), which enable the mathematical representation of the surface of arbitrarily-shaped particles such as grains of sand. We show that this ability to model shape enables unprecedented capture of the mechanics of granular materials across scales ranging from macroscopic behavior to local behavior to particle behavior. Specifically, the model is able to predict the onset and evolution of shear banding in sands, replicating the most advanced high-fidelity experiments in triaxial compression equipped with sequential X-ray tomography imaging. We present comparisons of the model and experiment at an unprecedented level of quantitative agreement—building a one-to-one model where every particle in the more than 53,000-particle array has its own avatar or numerical twin. Furthermore, the boundary conditions of the experiment are faithfully captured by modeling the membrane effect as well as the platen displacement and tilting. The results show a computational tool that can give insight into the physics and mechanics of granular materials undergoing shear deformation and failure, with computational times comparable to those of the experiment. One quantitative measure that is extracted from the LS-DEM simulations that is currently not available experimentally is the evolution of three dimensional force chains inside and outside of the shear band. We show that the rotations on the force chains are correlated to the rotations in stress principal directions.},

The quest for predictive nonlocal mechanical theories with well-defined internal length scales has been ongoing for more than a century since the seminal work of the Cosserats. We present here a novel framework for the nonlocal analysis of material behavior, which bypasses the need to define any internal length scale. This is achieved by extending the Data-Driven paradigm in mechanics, originally introduced for simple continua, into generalized continua. The problem is formulated directly on a material data set, comprised of higher-order kinematics and their conjugate kinetics, which are identified from experiments or inferred from lower scale computations. The case of a micropolar continuum is used as a vehicle to introduce the framework, which may also be adapted to strain-gradient and micromorphic media. Two applications are presented: a micropolar elastic plate with a hole, which is used to demonstrate the convergence properties of the method, and the shear banding problem of a triaxially compressed sample of quartz sand, which is used to demonstrate the applicability of the method in the case of complex history-dependent material behavior.},

   abstract = {It has been known that classical continuum mechanics laws fail to describe strain localization in granular materials due to the mathematical ill-posedness and mesh dependency. Therefore, a non-local theory with internal length scales is needed to overcome such problems. The micropolar and high-order gradient theories can be considered as good examples to characterize the strain localization in granular materials. The fact that internal length scales are needed requires micromechanical models or laws; however, the classical constitutive models can be enhanced through the stress invariants to incorporate the Micropolar effects. In this paper, Lade's single hardening model is enhanced to account for the couple stress and Cosserat rotation and the internal length scales are incorporated accordingly. The enhanced Lade's model and its material properties are discussed in detail; then the finite element formulations in the Updated Lagrangian Frame (UL) are used. The finite element formulations were implemented into a user element subroutine for ABAQUS (UEL) and the solution method is discussed in the companion paper. The model was found to predict the strain localization in granular materials with low dependency on the finite element mesh size. The shear band was found to reflect on a certain angle when it hit a rigid boundary. Applications for the model on plane strain specimens tested in the laboratory are discussed in the companion paper. Copyright ? 2006 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

   abstract = {A variational framework for the distance-minimizing data-driven computing method is proposed. We provide a mathematical view on data-driven boundary value problems as well as the associated mathematical tools. The notion of function spaces is introduced into a data-driven boundary value problem and thus it can be formulated as a continuous optimization problem. An explanation of a data-driven boundary value problem as a double-minimization problem is given. This problem is subsequently broken down into two single-minimization problems, one of which is a constrained optimization problem. The associated constraint is given in terms of differential equations and the method of choice is the method of Lagrange multipliers. For the constrained optimization problem, we seek solutions by solving a system of equations for nodal degrees of freedom. The second is an unconstrained optimization problem whose solution is sought by working with the values of the solution at quadrature points and the supplied material data. The proposed variational formulation renders the high-order polynomial interpolation to straightforward implementation. In particular, spectral element methods are employed to reduce the computational cost while assuring the high accuracy of the data-driven solution. Within the spirit of the variational formulation, diffusion and dynamic problems can be efficiently studied in the data-driven setting with only few necessary modifications. Some representative numerical examples for parabolic and hyperbolic equations are presented. Numerical convergence studies show the reliability and robustness of the proposed formulation.},

In the merit of a data-driven model the solution process is carried out by using directly the experimental data instead of the conventional constitutive laws. Thus it bypasses the uncertainties in fabricating the stress-strain functional relationships from material data. Consequently, the mathematical formulation involves an optimization problem with equality constraints consisting of the equilibrium equations in continuum mechanics and the compatibility conditions on the displacement field. In the framework of finite element formulation the element tangent stiffness, the generalized internal force and the generalized external force can be computed, which renders it amenable to the implementation of finite element procedures. The proposed scheme is validated through the applications to continuum elements and convergence studies of the data-driven solution in regard to the interpolation order, the mesh size as well as the data size. The variational structure allows to recognize the overall pattern of the system of equations to be solved. This includes the structural tangent stiffness and the generalized force vectors.},

On the basis of the principle of virtual work, and by an examination of the manner by which adjacent granules transmit forces through their contacts, a general representation is established for the macroscopic stresses in terms of the volume average of the (tensorial) product of the contact forces and the vectors which connect the centroids of adjacent contacting granules. Then the corresponding kinematics is examined and the overall macroscopic deformation rate and spin tensors are developed in terms of the volume average of relevant microscopic kinematical variables. As an illustration of the application of the general expressions developed, two explicit macroscopic results are deduced: (1) a dilatancy equqtion which both qualitatively and quantitatively seems to be in accord with experimental observation, and (2) a noncoaxiality equation which seems to support the vertex plasticity model. Since the development is based on a microstructural consideration, all material coefficients entering the results have well-defined physical interpretations. © 1981 by ASME.},

This method uses the discrete element method to incorporate both rolling resistances (rolling friction tangential force and rolling resistance moment) and the sliding friction tangential force between particles in the contact model on a microscopic scale, while the Cosserat continuum is used to describe the granular materials on a macroscopic scale. In addition, a consistent return mapping algorithm for the integration of the rate constitutive equation and the closed form of the consistent elastoplastic tangent modulus matrix for the generalized elastoplastic Cosserat continuum model are presented. The effectiveness of the developed multiscale method is demonstrated with two cases: one comparing discrete element computations with the Cosserat finite element analysis, and the other comparing a plane strain compression experiment using digital imaging measurements with the Cosserat finite element analysis. The rotational deformation and shear band failure modes are well reproduced in both cases. It also demonstrates that the present model has better performance in predicting the phenomena of shear bands than previous ones.},

After developing the formula for the covariant gradient relative to a surface metric, we derive versions of the Peterson–Mainardi–Codazzi and Gauss equations and Gauss’ Theorema Egregium relevant to a deformed material surface. We then apply our framework to kinematically constrained material surfaces. For material surfaces that can sustain only deformations that preserve either angles or lengths, we obtain explicit representations for the covariant gradient relative to the surface metric in terms of the surface gradient. We show also that a deformation of a material surface that preserves angles and areas must be length preserving and vice versa. Finally, we present an alternative derivation of the Peterson–Mainardi–Codazzi and Gauss equations for a deformed material surface subject to the provision that the surface metric derives from the metric for the ambient Euclidean space within which the surface is embedded.

The evolution of these material parameters is upscaled into classical two- and three-invariant plasticity models, effectively bypassing phenomenological hardening laws. The predictiveness of the method is clearly demonstrated by comparing its performance with experimental results and direct numerical simulations under homogeneous and inhomogeneous conditions.

   abstract = {The paper outlines an approach to the modelling of the overall macroscopic response of periodic granular materials based on a numerically evaluated micro-to-macro transition. We consider a homogenized macro-continuum with locally attached microstructure, representing an aggregate of discrete solid granules which possibly come into contact. The micromechanical material response is governed by the interaction of rigid particles based on a Coulomb-type friction law. Central results of the paper are new definitions of homogenized stresses and power-type microheterogeneity conditions for periodic particle aggregates undergoing deformations at finite strains. Here, the critical point is a precise formulation of periodicity conditions for center-displacement fluctuations and rotations of particles associated with a well-defined boundary of the unit cell, inducing the anti-periodicity of fictitious support forces and couples. With these definitions at hand, it is shown that both static and power-type approaches yield the identical symmetric macro-stress tensor. The overall expressions appear in an extremely compact format in terms of a periodicity frame and three support force resultants associated with the three faces of the unit cell. We show that these new representations of overall properties of granular aggregates are identical to those of microstructures for continuous heterogeneous materials, and can formally be obtained in a straightforward manner by a limit of microstresses to microforces on the boundary of the microstructure. On the computational side we outline details of an implicit incremental update algorithm that yields the proposed overall stresses of the particle aggregate in a quasi-static, macro-deformation-driven process. That includes fictitious dynamic relaxation processes based on artificial damping mechanisms in order to overcome the highly complex local instability problems of particle clusters within the quasi-static approach. The performance of the proposed framework is documented by means of a representative set of numerical examples. © 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

The results establish an important feature of the flow of sand during principal stress rotation, namely, nonuniqueness of flow or the dependency of the plastic strain increment direction on the stress increment direction. This feature contradicts the usual assumption in plasticity theory of a unique flow during loading causing plastic deformations in a material. Guided by the results of the experiments, a plastic potential theory capable of representing the dependency of the flow of sand on the stress increment direction is proposed.

   abstract = {Non-local formulations have been intensively applied for the past 20 years to control the strain localisation resulting from strain-softening constitutive laws. We propose a framework that encompasses most of these non-local approaches. It relies on an energetic interpretation of both equilibrium equations and constitutive relations for generalised standard materials. It allows a systematic exploration of the properties of these models. We focus here on three aspects: the existence of solutions when applied to strain-hardening laws, the effective localisation control when applied to strain-softening laws and the thermodynamic bases. A quite extended analysis is led under some assumptions, the more restrictive being that all the internal variables are dealt with the same regularising operator. It appears that only few approaches bring effective regularisation. Unfortunately, they do not rely on thermodynamic bases so that the Clausius-Duhem inequality is not automatically fulfilled. An alternative consists in giving up the assumptions of the analysis. In that case, it seems that no general result can be stated. Moreover, an illustration in the context of brittle damage shows that slightly different formulations can result in strongly differentiated behaviour, even though some specific choices lead nevertheless to a suitable model. © 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

   abstract = {Local damage models with softening needs localization limiters to preserve the mathematical and physical consistency. In this paper we compare the properties of strain-gradient and damage-gradient regularizations. Gradient-damage models introduce a quadratic dependency of the dissipated energy on the gradient of the damage field and are nowadays extensively used as phase-field approximation of brittle fracture. Their key feature is to provide a smeared approximation of a crack as a band of localized damage with a finite energy dissipation per unit of surface, that can be identified with the fracture toughness of the Griffith model. Strain gradient models introduce a quadratic dependence of the elastic energy on the gradient of the strain field. A similar term can be physically interpreted as the presence in the material of linear, but nonlocal, stiffnesses, that can be eventually be affected by damage. Despite this attractive interpretation, we have found that strain-gradient regularized models can hardly be used to approximate brittle fracture, because smeared cracks with non-vanishing and finite dissipated energies are hardly obtained. Our analysis is based on variational models and focuses on the one-dimensional traction problem.},

In conventional displacement-based approaches, the interpolation of displacement requires C1-continuity in order to ensure convergence of the finite element procedure for higher-order theories. Mixed-type finite elements are developed herein for the Fleck-Hutchinson theory; these elements use standard C0-continuous shape functions and can achieve the same convergence as C1 elements. These C0 elements use displacements and displacement gradients as nodal degrees of freedom. Kinematic constraints between displacement gradients are enforced via the Lagrange multiplier method. The elements developed all pass a patch test. The resulting finite element scheme is used to solve some representative linear elastic boundary value problems and the comparative accuracy of various types of element is evaluated.

The dominant fields are obtained in closed form, and finite element methods have been used to produce the solution over the entire field.

The proposed formulation naturally fits in the so-called nonlocal standard approach, whereby the framework of generalized standard materials is extended to include gradients of internal variables to account for the physics of the fracture phenomenon in a regularized sense, that is, via extended constitutive equations in which a length scale parameter brings to the macro level information about material microstructure. This concept is fully embodied into the present approach to quasi-brittle fracture, whereby progressive damage occurs in layers of finite thickness where the gradient of damage is bounded and a fully damaged region is understood as a fracture with no ambiguity. Key to the effective implementation of the model are the choice of two constitutive functions and the implicit tracking of regions in a state of progressive damage via Lagrange multipliers acting on internal constraints. The ideas are developed for a general Cauchy continuum and representative numerical simulations are included that demonstrate the model capabilities.},

The regularization comes from the addition of a Lipschitz constraint on the damage field. In other words, the free energy does not depend on the damage gradient. The search of the displacement and damage fields from one time-step to the next is based on an iterative staggered scheme. The displacement field is sought for a given damage field. Then, a Lipschitz continuous damage field is sought for a given displacement field. Both problems are convex. The solution to the latter benefits from bounds proven in a previous paper and used here.

Primarily in the form of barrier methods, interior-point techniques were popular during the 1960s for solving nonlinearly constrained problems. However, their use for linear programming was not even contemplated because of the total dominance of the simplex method. Vague but continuing anxiety about barrier methods eventually led to their abandonment in favor of newly emerging, apparently more efficient alternatives such as augmented Lagrangian and sequential quadratic programming methods. By the early 1980s, barrier methods were almost without exception regarded as a closed chapter in the history of optimization. This picture changed dramatically with Karmarkar's widely publicized announcement in 1984 of a fast polynomial-time interior method for linear programming; in 1985, a formal connection was established between his method and classical barrier methods. Since then, interior methods have advanced so far, so fast, that their influence has transformed both the theory and practice of constrained optimization. This article provides a condensed, selective look at classical material and recent research about interior methods for nonlinearly constrained optimization.},

The analysis of a certain time interval of a one-dimensional example is used to show how viscous and micromorphic regularization retains well-posedness within the softening regime. By way of contrast, the fracture energy concept is characterized by ill-posedness—as known from previous non-variational analyses. Numerical examples finally demonstrate the limitations and capabilities of each concept. The ill-posed local fracture energy concept leads by its design to a spatially constant fracture energy—in line with Griffith’s theory. The viscous regularization, in turn, yields a well-posed problem but artificial viscosity can add a bias to unloading and fracture thickness. Furthermore, and even more important, a viscous regularization does not predict a spatially constant fracture energy due to locally heterogeneous loading rates. The well-posed micromorphic regularization is in line with the underlying physics and does not show this undesired dependency. However, it requires the largest numerical efforts, since it is based on a coupled two-field formulation.},

   abstract = {Brittle materials fail by means of rapid cracks. Classical fracture mechanics describes the motion of tensile cracks that dissipate released elastic energy within a point-like zone at their tips. Within this framework, a "classical" tensile crack cannot exceed the Rayleigh wave speed, c R. Using brittle neo-hookean materials, we experimentally demonstrate the existence of "supershear" tensile cracks that exceed shear wave speeds, c R. Supershear cracks smoothly accelerate beyond c R , to speeds that could approach dilatation wave speeds. Supershear dynamics are governed by different principles than those guiding "classical" cracks; this fracture mode is excited at critical (material dependent) applied strains. This nonclassical mode of tensile fracture represents a fundamental shift in our understanding of the fracture process.},

Large deformation up to 15% is found for specimen thicknesses below 500 nm with variations depending on specimen size and frame compliance. The deformation is homogenous until fracture, with no evidence of shear banding. The yield stress is doubled when decreasing the specimen cross-section, reaching ∼3 GPa for small cross-sections. The fracture strain variation is related to both the stability of the test device and to the specimen size.

Local order, elastic properties and rate sensitivity are shown to be thickness independent, while hardness and fracture resistance are not. The increase of hardness with decreasing thickness is related to the substrate constraint on shear banding. Fracture surfaces exhibit a corrugated morphology, except for thickness below 400 nm exhibiting perfectly flat surfaces. The corrugations appear again on the thinnest films when adding a cap layer, indicating that the fracture mechanisms are primarily dominated by the loading configuration and geometry which constrain the plastic zone extension. Increasing the Ni content from 25% to 58% leads to an increase of elastic modulus, Poisson ratio, strength, activation volume, and fracture toughness. These changes can be understood based on the change in thermodynamic fragility and Zr-Ni bonds formation. Zr75Ni25 composition shows exceptionally large rate sensitivity exponent equal to 0.058. The fracture mechanisms are not modified by composition and the fracture toughness is systematically low due to the confinement of the plastic zone.},

   abstract = {Shear transformation (ST), as the fundamental event of plastic deformation of amorphous solids, is commonly considered as transient in time and thus assumed to be an equilibrium process without inertia. Such an approximation however poses a major challenge when the deformation becomes non-equilibrium, e.g., under the dynamic and even shock loadings. To overcome the challenge, this paper proposes a dynamic mesoscale model for amorphous solids that connects microscopically inertial STs with macroscopically elastoplastic deformation. By defining two dimensionless parameters: strain increment and intrinsic Deborah number, the model predicts a phase diagram for describing the inertia effect on deformation of amorphous solids. It is found that with increasing strain rate or decreasing ST activation time, the significant inertia effect facilitates the activation and interaction of STs, resulting in the earlier yield of plasticity and lower steady-state flow stress. We also observe that the externally-applied shock wave can directly drive the activation of STs far below the global yield and then propagation along the wave-front. These behaviors are very different from shear banding in the quasi-static treatment without considering the inertia effect of STs. The present study highlights the non-equilibrium nature of plastic events, and increases the understanding of dynamic or shock deformation of amorphous solids at mesoscale.},

The model captures accurately salient aspects of the material behavior including: the viscosity of Vitreloy 1 as a function of temperature and strain rate; the temperature and strain-rate dependence of the equilibrium free-volume concentration; the uniaxial compression stress-strain curves as a function of strain rate and temperature; and the dependence of shear-band spacing on plate thickness. Calculations suggest that, under adiabatic conditions, strain softening and localization in BMGs is due both to an increase in free volume and to the rise in temperature within the band. The calculations also suggest that the shear band spacing in plate-bending specimens is controlled by the stress relaxation in the vicinity of the shear bands. © Springer-Verlag 2005.},

   abstract = {A mesoscale simulation by shear transformation zone (STZ) dynamics is used to analyze the initial stages of shear localization in amorphous metals, of which many details remain unresolved due to the difficulty in accessing the appropriate time- and length-scales. Examination of a constant strain-rate tensile test of a model amorphous metal reveals four different stages in the microscopic processes that lead to formation of a shear band. These stages are identified as: (i) STZ clustering, where potential nucleation sites form as STZ activations cluster in space; (ii) growth following nucleation, where a nascent shear band exhibits a propagating front that defines the shear band path; (iii) relaxation thickening, where the shear band thickens and relaxes the system down to the flow stress; and (iv) flow thickening, where the shear band exhibits prolonged thickening at the flow stress. The results are consistent with the literature but suggest that a shear band is defined by a front that propagates very quickly with negligible accumulated strain. This propagating front likely occurs below the resolution of current methods that only observe simultaneous slip in a shear band where significant strain can be accumulated at much slower rates. Analysis of a thermodynamic model also suggests a specific critical stress that is required to nucleate a shear band, after which the shear band is allowed to grow unconstrained. © 2013 Acta Materialia Inc.

Moreover, to describe both the brittle and ductile failure modes presented during the tensile and compressive deformations of BMGs, respectively, a failure criterion is established by introducing a stress triaxiality, which can describe the failure characteristics of BMGs under different stress states.

   abstract = {Amorphous metallic alloys, or metallic glasses, are lucrative engineering materials owing to their superior mechanical properties such as high strength and large elastic strain. However, their main drawback is their propensity for highly catastrophic failure through rapid shear banding, significantly undercutting their structural applications. Here, we show that when reduced to 100 nm, Zr-based metallic glass nanopillars attain ceramic-like strengths (2.25 GPa) and metal-like ductility (25%) simultaneously. We report separate and distinct critical sizes for maximum strength and for the brittle-to-ductile transition, thereby demonstrating that strength and ability to carry plasticity are decoupled at the nanoscale. A phenomenological model for size dependence and brittle-to-homogeneous deformation is provided.},

   abstract = {Slowly strained solids deform via intermittent slips that exhibit a material-independent critical size distribution. Here, by comparing two disparate systems - granular materials and bulk metallic glasses - we show evidence that not only the statistics of slips but also their dynamics are remarkably similar, i.e. independent of the microscopic details of the material. By resolving and comparing the full time evolution of avalanches in bulk metallic glasses and granular materials, we uncover a regime of universal deformation dynamics. We experimentally verify the predicted universal scaling functions for the dynamics of individual avalanches in both systems, and show that both the slip statistics and dynamics are independent of the scale and details of the material structure and interactions, thus settling a long-standing debate as to whether or not the claim of universality includes only the slip statistics or also the slip dynamics. The results imply that the frictional weakening in granular materials and the interplay of damping, weakening and inertial effects in bulk metallic glasses have strikingly similar effects on the slip dynamics. These results are important for transferring experimental results across scales and material structures in a single theory of deformation dynamics.},

   abstract = {Concurrent multiple-scale methods can be defined as those which combine information available from distinct length and time scales into a single coherent, coupled simulation. These methods have recently become both popular and necessary for the following reasons. One is the recent discovery of new, nanoscale materials, and the corresponding boom in nanotechnology research. Another factor is that experiments have conclusively shown the connection between microscale physics and macroscale deformation. Finally, the concept of linking disparate length and time scales has become feasible recently due to the ongoing explosion in computational power. We present a detailed introduction to the available technologies in the field of multiple-scale analysis. In particular, our review centers on methods which aim to couple molecular-level simulations (such as molecular dynamics) to continuum level simulations (such as finite element and meshfree methods). Using this definition, we first review existing multiple-scale technology, and explain the pertinent issues in creating an efficient yet accurate multiple-scale method. Following the review, we highlight a new multiple-scale method, the bridging scale, and compare it to existing multiple-scale methods. Next, we show example problems in which the bridging scale is applied to fully non-linear problems. Concluding remarks address the research needs for multiple-scale methods in general, the bridging scale method in particular, and potential applications for the bridging scale. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

   abstract = {The variational approach to fracture is effective for simulating the nucleation and propagation of complex crack patterns but is computationally demanding. The model is a strongly nonlinear non-convex variational inequality that demands the resolution of small length scales. The current standard algorithm for its solution, alternate minimization, is robust but converges slowly and demands the solution of large, ill-conditioned linear subproblems. In this paper, we propose several advances in the numerical solution of this model that improve its computational efficiency. We reformulate alternate minimization as a nonlinear Gauss–Seidel iteration and employ over-relaxation to accelerate its convergence; we compose this accelerated alternate minimization with Newton's method, to further reduce the time to solution, and we formulate efficient preconditioners for the solution of the linear subproblems arising in both alternate minimization and in Newton's method. We investigate the improvements in efficiency on several examples from the literature; the new solver is five to six times faster on a majority of the test cases considered. © 2016 The Authors International Journal for Numerical Methods in Engineering Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

   abstract = {Phase-field modeling of fracture phenomena in solids is a very promising approach which has gained popularity within the last decade. However, within the finite element framework, already a two-dimensional quasi-static phase-field formulation is computationally quite demanding, mainly for the following reasons: (i) the need to resolve the small length scale inherent to the diffusive crack approximation calls for extremely fine meshes, at least locally in the crack phase-field transition zone, (ii) due to non-convexity of the related free-energy functional, a robust, but slowly converging staggered solution scheme based on algorithmic decoupling is typically used. In this contribution we tackle problem (ii) and propose a faster and equally accurate approach for quasi-static phase-field computing of (brittle) fracture using a monolithic solution scheme which is accompanied by a novel line search procedure to overcome the iterative convergence issues of non-convex minimization. We present a detailed critical evaluation of the approach and its comparison with the staggered scheme in terms of computational cost, accuracy and robustness.},

   abstract = {Data Driven Computational Mechanics (DDCM) solves the boundary value problem by directly relying on the strain-stress data, bypassing the need for a constitutive model. In presence of materials exhibiting a softening response, Finite Element analyses performed with a constitutive model typically use a length scale, which can be introduced into the problem in multiple ways. A few commonly used ways include the addition of the gradient of damage variable in the energy density functional, using the gradient of strain while evaluating the internal variable, and so on. However, in the context of DDCM, these techniques may not be effective as the internal variables are not explicitly defined. Hence, the current article introduces a regularization technique, where the gradient of strain is constrained to lie within some interval. This prevents strain localization within an element by introducing a length scale into the problem. This article demonstrates the effectiveness of such a regularization technique in the case of 1D problems using a constitutive model while comparing its performance with strain gradient (SG) models.},
