Data-driven computational mechanics enables the direct use of material databases within finite element analysis through an alternate minimization between mechanical and material states. This work investigates the behavior of this algorithm in the presence of damage-induced softening and snapback instabilities. By analytically prescribing the material response, database discretization effects are eliminated and the algorithmic behavior is isolated. The results show that tangent-consistent hyper-parameters and arc-length continuation are essential to achieve stable convergence and to follow post-peak response. A regularization strategy introducing an intrinsic length scale is then proposed and its effectiveness and implications are demonstrated through one- and two-dimensional numerical examples.
